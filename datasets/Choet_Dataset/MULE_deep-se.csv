MULE-6432,"Implement true multicast functionality for <all> processor","Currently <all> processes messages sequentially. It could be an issue if message processors inside <all> take long time to respond (e.g. multiple request-response endpoints). We discussed it with MikeS and agreed that the behavior should be configurable (e.g. <all multicast=""true"">) - if set to true, <all> will spawn multiple threads inside. If one of the MPs inside <all> throws an Exception, it should return MuleExceptionMessage which should be included in the response collection, then Exception Strategy should be invoked.  ",8
MULE-5990,"Does Mule support XA transaction on XA resources used by a Spring object component ?","As you should know, a common use case is the bridge pattern :  * read a message from an inbound endpoint (from a JMS queue or/and a database through JDBC).  * writing the message to an outbound endpoint (to a JMS queue or/and a database through JDBC).    {code:xml}     <service name=""myBridgeService"">       <inbound>         <jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox""/>       </inbound>       <outbound>         <multicasting-router>           <jms:outbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/outbox"" />           <jdbc:outbound-endpoint queryKey=""insertMessageStmt"" />         </multicasting-router>       </outbound>     </service>  {code}     What happens then if something goes wrong when writing the result to the outbound endpoint (eg. jdbc endpoint)? If you don't use XA Transaction on inbound and outbound endpoints, the message will not be rollbacked to the inbound endpoint in case of an Exception. So you will have to solve this issue by configuring <xa-transaction> on each endpoint with the appropriate transaction strategy.     {code:xml}     <service name=""myBridgeService"">       <inbound>         <jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox"">           <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_BEGIN"" />         </jms:inbound-endpoint>       </inbound>       <outbound>         <multicasting-router>           <jms:outbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/outbox"">             <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />           </jms:outbound-endpoint>           <jdbc:outbound-endpoint queryKey=""insertMessageStmt"">             <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />           </jdbc:outbound-endpoint>         </multicasting-router>       </outbound>     </service>  {code}     But what happens now if you have a component between inbound and outbound enpoints ?    {code:xml}    <service name=""myDaoService"">      <inbound>        <jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox"">          <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_BEGIN"" />        </jms:inbound-endpoint>      </inbound>      <component>        <spring-object bean=""messageDao"" />      </component>      <outbound>        <multicasting-router>          <jms:outbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/outbox"">            <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />          </jms:outbound-endpoint>          <jdbc:outbound-endpoint queryKey=""insertMessageStmt"">            <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />          </jdbc:outbound-endpoint>        </multicasting-router>      </outbound>    </service>  {code}    In most cases, the Spring object component (eg. messsageDao) will execute complicated business operations (from a currently existing business API) and also use a DataSource to execute several SQL select and update statements before returning a result to the outbound. These JDBC operations will be handled likely by Spring JdbcTemplate or even HibernateTemplate.    As far as I understand, Mule is fully responsible to handle enlistment/delistment and close of XA resources (see _org.mule.transaction.XaTransaction_). So by default, XA resources used by a Spring object component will not be handled by Mule and will not participate in the XA transaction started from Mule.    For completeness... I've also found a unit test for this usecase in Mule distribution under MULE_HOME/src/mule-3.1.2-src.zip/org/mule/test/integration/transaction/XATransactionsWithSpringDAO.java. When you execute this test, you will have a successful result but the XA resource used by the dao bean is not enlisted nor delisted in/from the transaction started from Mule. ",8

MULE-6172,"Upgrade apache-commons-pool","Since error handling in current version of Apache commons-pool is buggy (borrowConnection method throws a NoSuchElementException losing the original cause) we may need to update the library.

MULE-6441,"Inconsistent behaviour of foreach with inside flowvar","The index of the foreach inside the flow of the flowref is not consistent.  It seems that there is a lack of atomicity with the invocation variables causing as a result jump of indexes of the iteration and overwrite of invocation variables.    In the example below my payload is the result of a sql query so an ArrayList<CaseInsensitiveHashMap>. I save the value of each row in a flow variable to make it always available in next operations (the original project has more flowRef).  The problem comes out because in the contained flow accessed by the flowRef, the invocation variable carrying the index of the iteration and also the name of the element that I saved is not consistent during each iteration. Sometimes some idexes are jumped and also the element of my array tooks more time the same value.",5

MULE-6861,"Watermark / Binding object store items to flow variables","h1. Watermarking       Right now, when a poll needs to deal with updated objects, we use watermarks as an approach to filter out elements that were already processed.  Watermarks require a value to be persisted across flow invocations. Typically, this value will have a default the first time used, and will be used as part of a query or outbound request. Based on how the flow processes the results, the value may be updated.      This can be done using several steps:       - Fetch a value form a persistent object store and save it as a flow variable       - Refer to the flow variable when doing a query / outbound request       - Update the variable based (either once - i.e. the watermark is the date of the query, or per record - i.e. the watermark is the highest id from an object)       - At the end of the processing, persist the value to the persistent object store         This pattern is very common in synchronisation flows. Enough common to deserve better support. To make this easier out of the box we will add a new optional parameter to <poll> that will provide the watermarking variable persistence out of the box.    Watermark Example:    {code:xml}  <flow name=""pollSalesforce"">                 <poll frequency=""10m"">           <watermark key=""lastModifiedDate""               default-expression=""#[lastYear()]""               object-store-ref=""myOS"" />           <sfdc:search query=""Select Id,Name from Account where LastModifiedDate >= #[flowVars['lastModifiedDate']]""/>         <foreach>               <set-variable name=""accountLastModified"" value=""max(payload['LastModifiedDate']], flowVars['accountLastModified'])""/>         </foreach>    .....  </flow>  {code}    h2. Watermark properties      * variable (required): This attribute signals both the object store key that will be used to store this watermark as also the name of the flowVar in which its value will be exposed to the user.   * default-expression (required): In case that the key above can't be found on the object store, the default expression is used to generate a value. This is useful for the first run of the flow   * update-expression (optional): The result of this expression will be used to update the watermark once the execution is finished. It defaults to the value of the variable parameter.  * objectStore-ref (optional): A reference to the object store you wish to use to store the watermarks. If not provided, the default user object store will be used     h2. Watermark behaviour     * It is bound to the poll   * It is bound to synchronous flows only. If not then it execution must fail  * When executed, it goes to the configured object store looking for a value of the given key. If found, that value is exposed through a flowVar using the same key.   * If no value is found for that key in the object store, then the default-expression is executed and that value is exposed through the flowVar.  * Watermark will also fire a notification interceptable by the event tracking module. The underlaying tracking event will be enriched with the watermark value.  * The message processors will be executed.  * If the flow was correctly executed, then the watermark will be updated.   * After updating the object store, another notification is fired to the event tracking system so that the new value can also be recorded there   * If the intercepted processors throw any exceptions, then the watermark will not be updated. Since the watermark is stored in the object store, the user can always use a exception strategy to put a custom value in case of failure.  * In case the watermark value is not serializable then fail the store of the watermark in the object store  ",5

For that reason, we are using the ""for-each"" message processor, and inside it, we throw an ""Async"" with a ""Flow-Ref"" to the flow that process each element.    The problem is that it's seems to be a bug that randomly (let's say 4 our of 10) throws a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException.    As you can see in the log output, this exception is thrown while the Async is copying the event to create a new one to fire a new thread.    The exact error is located at DefaultMuleEvent.java:938, where it says:    message.getInvocationPropertyNames().     So, what i guess it's happening here is that when creating a new event, the copy is saving some kind of reference to the same maps instead of creating a new ones.    Then, if some new flow var is created in the process item flow, while the async is still firing new thread (that means, copy new events), they are getting mixed up and crash.    I'm attached a simple Studio 3.4 GA based project where you can reproduce the bug. Just run the app, and you will see the exception in the console.

This has several problems:   * It doesn't allow to properly setup JCE providers as part of the platform configuration, something required to use a FIPS 140-2 compliant JCE provider  * It fixes on old versions of the providers and doesn't leverage improvements made in the platforms, like IBM's improved JCE driver (currently we use a JCE provider that is 6+ years old on IBM JVMs)  * It fixes the SSL/TLS versions supported, which causes SSL endpoints to support SSL3 (considered deprecated) but no TLS    The java platform provides sensible defaults for all these, which get updated as the security landscape evolves, and which can be defined as part of the JVM configuration.   Remove the ""discovery"" of defaults, and use platform defaults for operations in and depending on TlsConfiguration.    Acceptance criteria:  It should be possible to use any JCE provider defined in the JVM environment in order to support FIPS compliant providers.  Endpoints should rely on the registered JCE provider for SSL and use the default ssl type instead of hardcoding one (As FIPS providers will disable several modes and only allow TLS 1.0+).  ",5

The clear() method that was added in 3.5.0-ME allows reclaiming the storage but the QueueManager still keeps in-memory resources that are never freed.    Therefore the QueueManager interface needs to add the following method:    void disposeQueue(Queue);    This method frees all resources currently held by the queue including the storage (meaning that queue.clear() will be invoked automatically)    Additionally, another common need when dealing with short lived queues is the ability to easily create/retrieve queues with custom configurations.

This relies on ASM, Objenesis and other non standard instantiaton methods that have as a side effects that transient fields initialized in line not being initialized.    For example:    private transient Map<String, DataHandler> inboundAttachments = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, DataHandler>();    When the MuleMessage is initialized through Objenesis, inboundAttachments will be null since a new constructor is added via ASM which ignores the transient fields.

This is caused by:   1. In the constructor of org.mule.transport.tcp.TcpSocketKey, an InetSocketAddress is constructed. If host resolution fails, the object is created anyway.   2. In org.mule.transport.tcp.TcpSocketFactory, 'getAddress()' is called on the socket key and passed directly into socket.connect(...).   3.

The convention in mule is to treat these fields as resource paths, which would allow URLs, absolute files, but will also look for resource files (relative to the current classpath, and possibly inside a jar).    Change the behavior so that the wsdl location is treated as a reouce location.  ",1

MULE-7311,"Lack of synchronization causes multiple expiration requests on Aggregator groups","The test EventCorrelatorTestCase.processesExpiredGroupInPrimaryNode fails intermitently due to a lack of synchronization in the access to an object store between different threads, that sporadically leads to a group expiry being triggered several times.    This may be a problem if the correlation is setup to process the group at expiration instead of giving an error.    The problem is mitigated when using persistent object stores as I/O synchronisation is creating an adhoc happens-after causality.",8

As a consequence, if you have an API with multiple ports, one of them receiving a SOAP 1.1 envelope, and other one receiving a SOAP 1.2 envelope, and if you don't specify the port and the soapVersion in both proxies (service and client) you will not be able to send a SOAP 1.2 message.

That operation works perfectly.    However, in localhost:8081/test I'm trying to consume an operation which doesn't take any parameters. There's no way to make this work because:    1) WS consumer is expecting me to generate the soap envelope using datamapper, however, I don't have a payload to transform so I'm forced to create a dummy map  2) Because the operation is expecting no parameters, the XML that DataMapper generates looks like this: <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>  3) The above results in WS consumer returning this error, basically because there's no envelope to consume:    org.mule.api.transport.DispatchException: COULD_NOT_READ_XML_STREAM. Failed to route event via endpoint: org.mule.module.cxf.CxfOutboundMessageProcessor. Message payload is of type: PostMethod    Error put aside, it doesn't make sense to me that:    * It seems like the only easy way to generate the SOAP envelopes is through DataMapper, which is not a CE feature like WS Consumer is  * How do I create a valid envelope when the operation takes no parameters?  * Because envelope generation depends on datamapper, I have to drop the WS Consumer box in the canvas before the DataMapper one.

I should have to be forced to create completely artificial set-payload and datamapper message processors for doing something as simple as asking for the weather of a ZIP number. I should't have to write the SOAP body myself either. Any of these two options defeat the purpose of the component.    I should be able to just pass the ws:consumer whatever attributes the invocation takes and it should be able to construct the body. ",8

For example, fetchSize=5 and a resultset of 20 records will imply 4 chunks of 5 records each.

Explanation    The method *characters* of class *org.dom4j.io.SAXContentHandler* can generate multiple text nodes if *mergeAdjacentText* property is set to false.    An excellent explanation of the reasons of why this happen can be found [here|http://www.mail-archive.com/dom4j-user@lists.sourceforge.net/msg02690.html].    The effect of this problem is that certain xpath expression, most notably related to the use of the text() selector, can return an array of text nodes instead of a single text node. This can lead to incomplete text values or wrong comparisons.    This problem was discovered while dealing with a message properties transformer, where new message properties are added using xpath expressions to retrieve some values from an XML payload (this payload is converted to a DOM Document by means of the XmlToDomDocument transformer).     This problem also affect the Expression Filter when using an xpath evaluator (uncomment the expression-filter element in the attached Mule configuration file to see it in action).

MULE-7617,"Design a stable API so that extensions can be added to the ESB","This involves designing a stable API that can be used to create ESB extensions.   The initial scope of extensions will be operation blocks that represent an arbitrary operation on the payload.    The goal of this API is to isolate any such extension as much as possible from the ESB classes, allowing to specify operations at an abstract level, that can be automatically mapped to XML constructs in an automated fashion, and provides enough metadata so that both the runtime and tooling can leverage the new operations without further work.    This task is exploratory. The scope is to define a small subset of the API, and determine the registration and consumption mechanism as a proof of concept.    Note that this API has two different parts, one consumed by extension modules, and one consumed by the ESB/Tools, and we look to provide API stability on both surfaces.          ",8
MULE-7588,"LifeCycle is inconsistent across registries","Because the LifeCycle manager handles individual objects instead of the mule context as a whole, there're differences in how the life cycle is applied to objects in the TransientRegistry in opposition to the ones in the SpringRegistry:    * Objects in the TransientRegistry have a correct life cycle  * Objects in the Spring registry that were registered by Mule's bootstrap, receive the Start and Stop phases correctly. They don't receive the dispose phase and the init one is invoked by Spring directly as an init-method, not through the life cycle execution.  * Because default Spring registry objects don't receive the init through standard life cycle phase, they cannot be started before the TransientRegistry  * Objects manually added to the spring registry by an app, don't receive the initialise nor dispose phases  * LifeCycle is applied on Spring registry objects once they're all available in the application context. However, objects in the TransientRegistry get their lifecycle as they're registered, making it impossible for component A to reference component B if A is not registered first.    This issue greatly depends on MULE-7587  ",13

MULE-7923,"Better support for sequential processing in scatter-gather","Scatter Gather replaces the <all> router which was deprecated in 3.5.0. However, it doesn't behave that well on sequential use cases as its predecesor.    That's because if you configure a threading pool of just one, the processing is not sequential just across the routers but across all executions of the flow.     Another misbehaving use case is the one in which the routes are extremely fast, like just a couple of ms each. In that case, the overall response gain is lower than the time penalty of managing the threads.    To accommodate for these use cases we need to better support the sequential case of scatter gather, its threading profile type should change from asynchronousThreadingProfileType to threadingProfileType. This will enable a doThreading option which when set to false will execute always on the same thread, behaving similar to the old <all> router.  ",1

People can use databases for that. If, at some point, we have time to do this - we can look at it. If anyone feels differently about this, ping me on slack and I can explain in more depth.     For #2 and #3, we identified a few areas that need to be addressed. I am summarizing the discussion between Pablo and I, so some of this address part of the solution and not the problem :). I think it's all open for debate FWIW.     We need to clarify the semantics around persistence and clustering for ObjectStores. We identified 3 different modes that we need to support clustered + persistent, clustered + non-persistent. Right now, CloudHub implements clustered + persistent, while ESB implements clustered + non-persistent. Either we need to make this more explicit inside the ESB or remove one of the modes. Also, the two different modes have very different availability characteristics on cloudhub, so it's important to know what type of persistence a component is selecting.  Partionable object store stuff is currently very messy. it's supposed to be an internal semantic, but it gets exposed to consumers (e.g. routers). ObjectStoreManager shoudl be handling naming/partitioning underneath the covers. If not, this ends up being a layer on top of ObjectStores, and it becomes harder to build a management interface around it.  Key-value store use cases require an update method.  We need to document the consistency model - e.g. write last wins  We need an ObjectStore which can use the new database connector for on-prem customers.  We need an easy way for users to specify new object stores via XML which get created via the ObjectStoreManager. Use case here is that I want to specify an objectstore specifically for my cache which has a specified TTL and maximum # of values. I don't believe this is possible right now. (rinse and repeat for any other mule component)    Pablo Abad - we didn't talk about #6, but I thought of it while writing this up, so just capturing it.

MULE-8173,"Add protocol attribute to listener-config and request-config to improve usability","Currently is difficult for an user to realice how to configure HTTPS for listening HTTP requests or sending HTTP requests. The way to do that currently is by defining a TLS Context element (which can be empty for sending request, in such case it will use jvm default certificatess) inside the listener-config or de request-config element. That it's not straightforward if the user is working with XML and for users that do not know that SSL / TLS is the protocol behing HTTPS isn't either despite they use Studio.    The idea is to add a protocol attribute (with default value HTTP) in the listener-config and the request-config.  - Listener config:     - if user sets protocol=""http"" or provides no values then we validate that the user didn't put a TlsContext.     - If user sets protocol=""https"" we validate that the user provided a TlsContext with at least a keystore configured on it.   - Request config:     - if user sets protocol=""http"" or provides no value then we validate that the user didn't put a TlsContext     - if user sets protocol=""https"" and provides no TlsContext config then we create a TlsContext by default (implicitly) using the default jvm certificates  - if http is selected, port 80 is used by default  - if https is selected, port 443 is used by default    The usability improvements is:   From Studio the user has a much more easy way to find where to define the use of HTTPS since it's going to be in the main configuration section of both listener-config and request-config   From XML the user will see a hint from the XML content assistant to pick the protocol right in the listener-config element or request-config element.    With the new behaviour there's no reason to support an empty tls:context element in the config.  When we rebuild the current TCP transport ideally we can reuse the same mechanism as in HTTP (no idea what the ""protocol"" attribute would be called in that case) or add support for an empty tls:context again.

MULE-8210,"Support parameter grouping in Configurations and Operations","There are cases in which a group of parameters are frequently used together, for which it makes sense to treat them as a group.    The extensions api already supports mapping pojos directly in the XML, but in same cases which group is preferred as parameters rather than a top level object.    To enable that, the @Parameters operation will be created    {code:java}         @Extension       public class MyExtension {             @Parameters           private Options options;       }         public class Options {            @Parameter            private String color;              @Parameter            @Optional            private String mode;              private String owner;       }   }  {code}    The outcome of the code above is a configuration with two parameters called 'color' and 'mode', one required and the other optional.  The configuration has no attribute called options. If the Options class were to have another field also annotated with @Parameters, then such fields will be ignored.    In the same way, the annotation can be applied to a class holding operations:    {code:java}       public class Operations {             @Parameters           private Options options;             @Operation           public void hello(String message) {               ...           }             @Operation           public void goodBye(String message) {             }    }  {code}    In this case, both operations will have three parameters: message, color and mode.    The last use case for this annotation is to have nested parameter classes:  {code:java}       public class Options {              @Parameter            private String color;              @Parameter            @Optional            private String mode;              @Parameters            private MoreOptions moreOptions;       }       }  {code}    In this last example, the configuration/operation that is augmented with this extra parameters will have the sum of Options and MoreOptions parameters. Those parameters will be flattened, meaning that the model will contain no reference to the fact that the MoreOptions parameters were nested inside Options.    The field must be a Java bean property (ie it needs to have setters and getters matching the field name).",8

For that purpose, two new annotations are created:    @Extensible: means that a given type is extensible by another extension. It doesn't mean type subclassing, but extension from a functionality point of view. This annotation has an optional String alias() attribute to allow a better experience when generating XSD    @ImplementationOf(type=XX.class): This annotation can be used on a class or method implementing operations.

So you will have to solve this issue by configuring <xa-transaction> on each endpoint with the appropriate transaction strategy.     {code:xml}     <service name=""myBridgeService"">       <inbound>         <jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox"">           <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_BEGIN"" />         </jms:inbound-endpoint>       </inbound>       <outbound>         <multicasting-router>           <jms:outbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/outbox"">             <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />           </jms:outbound-endpoint>           <jdbc:outbound-endpoint queryKey=""insertMessageStmt"">             <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />           </jdbc:outbound-endpoint>         </multicasting-router>       </outbound>     </service>  {code}     But what happens now if you have a component between inbound and outbound enpoints ?    {code:xml}    <service name=""myDaoService"">      <inbound>        <jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox"">          <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_BEGIN"" />        </jms:inbound-endpoint>      </inbound>      <component>        <spring-object bean=""messageDao"" />      </component>      <outbound>        <multicasting-router>          <jms:outbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/outbox"">            <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />          </jms:outbound-endpoint>          <jdbc:outbound-endpoint queryKey=""insertMessageStmt"">            <xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN"" />          </jdbc:outbound-endpoint>        </multicasting-router>      </outbound>    </service>  {code}    In most cases, the Spring object component (eg. messsageDao) will execute complicated business operations (from a currently existing business API) and also use a DataSource to execute several SQL select and update statements before returning a result to the outbound. These JDBC operations will be handled likely by Spring JdbcTemplate or even HibernateTemplate.    As far as I understand, Mule is fully responsible to handle enlistment/delistment and close of XA resources (see _org.mule.transaction.XaTransaction_). So by default, XA resources used by a Spring object component will not be handled by Mule and will not participate in the XA transaction started from Mule.    For completeness... I've also found a unit test for this usecase in Mule distribution under MULE_HOME/src/mule-3.1.2-src.zip/org/mule/test/integration/transaction/XATransactionsWithSpringDAO.java. When you execute this test, you will have a successful result but the XA resource used by the dao bean is not enlisted nor delisted in/from the transaction started from Mule. ",8

Also, in the proxy scenario (using a listener and a requester) connections are kept alive but not reused.

To reproduce so, I'm attaching a small SOAP server (demo-soap-server.zip) and a mule app to try it out [2]. The endpoint I'm hitting is http://localhost:9000/acme-crm/orders?wsdl where the valid credentials are  user: admin  pass: admin.    In the mule app there are two flows to be executed   * (a) http://localhost:8081/goodCredentials where once it's hit you will see something like the following in a browser  {code:xml}<ns2:CreateResponse><return>0</return></ns2:CreateResponse>{code}  * and (b) http://localhost:8081/badCredentials where once it's hit you will wait for the default timeout of the WSC to be consumed, seeing at the end the stack trace in the mule app [1].    The issue here is that, despite the app will fail because of bad credentials, the developer should be warn that the error was an unauthorized rather than timed-outed.

I am using the salesforce connector v6.2.1 and this is how my authorize call looks like:    <sfdc:authorize       display=""#[flowVars['display']]""       authorizationUrl=""#[flowVars['salesForceUrl'] + '/authorize']""       accessTokenUrl=""#[flowVars['salesForceUrl'] + '/token']""       config-ref=""sfdcConnectorConfig""       state=""#[payload]""       accessTokenId=""#[flowVars['remoteUserId']]"" />    The flowVar salesforceUrl can take 2 possible values, which are:  https://login.salesforce.com (Salesforce Production)  https://test.salesforce.com (Salesforce Sandbox)    When a user does the OAuth dance to login.salesforce.com at the same time another user does the OAuth dance to test.salesforce.com, one of the dances fail.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I believe the problem can be found in the way the accessTokenUrl is retrieved and saved by these 2 processors (in mule-devkit-support):  - org.mule.security.oauth.processor.BaseOAuth2AuthorizeMessageProcessor<T>  - org.mule.security.oauth.processor.OAuth2FetchAccessTokenMessageProcessor    The BaseOAuth2AuthorizeMessageProcessor<T> (line 81) saves the accessTokenUrl value in the defaultUnauthorizedConnector object of the OAuth2Manager.  The OAuth2FetchAccessTokenMessageProcessor (line 57) obtains an OAuth2Adapter (used to fetch the access token) from the OAuth2Manager. The OAuth2Manager creates the adapter setting the accessTokenUrl (line 256 BaseOAuth2Manager<T>) with the value taken from the defaultUnauthorizedConnector object.    https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/mule-3.5.2/modules/devkit-support/src/main/java/org/mule/security/oauth/processor/BaseOAuth2AuthorizeMessageProcessor.java#L81    https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/mule-3.5.2/modules/devkit-support/src/main/java/org/mule/security/oauth/processor/OAuth2FetchAccessTokenMessageProcessor.java#L57    https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/mule-3.5.2/modules/devkit-support/src/main/java/org/mule/security/oauth/BaseOAuth2Manager.java#L256    The defaultUnauthorizedConnector of the OAuth2Manager is common to all events and threads.

MULE-8822,"OAuth2 Refresh token logic fails after restart for preexistent connection","This issue is related to the problem encountered in JIRA MULE-8277.    After restarting an application that uses the Box Connector, the first time a box request is made with a preexisting Box connection, that has an expired access token in its OAuthState, a refresh token process is triggered that does not attempt to save the refresh and access token obtained from box in the connector's ObjectStore.    The Box connector postAuthorize method invokes one of the connector's processors in order to retrieve the id of the user after the OAuth2 dance for identification purposes. That request within the postAuthorize triggers the first refresh token process for the connector on its first use after restart.    The way to reproduce the issue would be:  - Run a mule application on mule 3.6.2 with the Box Connector and a persistent Objectstore for it  - Do the OAuth dance with a Box user using the authorize MessageProcessor.  - Wait until the Box access token expires or modify it in the OAuthState saved in the Objectstore to make it invalid  - Restart the mule application and attempt to run a Box MessageProcessor like <box:get-user /> twice. (The first attempt should refresh but not save and the second should fail to refresh)",5

When users consumes external jar, they cannot modify the code. Also if they generate java stubs from a WSDL using CXF, they will need to modify a huge amount of Pojos just to get this to work properly, and what is worst, if a new version of the WSDL goes out and you try to update your connector, you will lose everything after generating the new stubs.    The mechanism should be that if the Pojo has any field annotated with @Parameter, then the current logic is valid and should only expose those fields. However, if the Pojo has no @Parameter, every single field that has a gettter and setter should be taken into account (including nested pojo fields)",8

MULE-9211,"Configurations should be able to have dynamic parameters which don't trigger dynamic configurations","Currently, all configuration parameters with expression values are translated into a DynamicConfigurationResolver. This is fine for most cases    There're other cases though in which it's desirable to have dynamic values which shouldn't necessarily trigger a new config instance. For example, an FTP connector which needs to switch between ASCII and BINARY mode. It should be fairly easy to switch modes through the use of an expression, but we don't want to trigger new connection pools for each case. Only connection credentials should trigger that.    To enable this case, we can leverage the ValueResolver<T> object which already exists in the extension-support module.    The config can have:    {code:java}  @Parameter  private ValueResolver<String> transferMode;  {code}    and then when you want to get the value you go:    {code:java}  ftpConnector.getTransferMode().resolve(event);  {code}",8

The behavior should be that:    1) The annotation can be either completely absent or present but with all optional parameters  2) The namespace attribute will be derived from the extension name by transforming to lower case, removing all occurrences of the ""connector"" String and hyphenizing  3) The schemaLocation should default to http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/{1}, where {1} is replaced by the namespace value  4) The schemaVersion should default to the Major and minor components of the Semver extension version, without classifiers.
