Clipping or ellipsis would not help much. We can fit 5 digit numbers before this occurs.    Q: What happens when the nav items exceed the available space?

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.

A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?

Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.

JSW-7983,"Edit startDate of a fixVersion in JIRA","As Patrick, I want to be able to edit startDate for a fixVersion in JIRA so that the experience between GH and JIRA is consistent and not confusing.    h4. Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?  A: (/) When the Version meta data is asked for in GH, it will check to see if it exists in JIRA as well. If so, it will be migrated over.",8
JSW-8014,"Display a trendline for version chart","As Patrick, I want to see a trendline on the version chart so I can understand how the projection works.
