MDL-1626,"Forum: Per-discussion subscription","I am finding that my inbox is absolutely flooded with unwanted moodle mails off the forum script. This is very annoying and I know it will similarly annoy my users. In fact it will put them off the system.    The problem arises because unlike other discussion boards moodle messages are emailed to me from the entire forum, not just the thread I have started or responded to. The overwhelming of people's inboxes is a serious business: it could be said that moodle is generating spam because the email feature is so unfocused.    Is there any chance this is going to be improved please?",100

MDL-10115,"A use profile's course list is arbitarily limited with no way of seeing complete list","When viewing a user's profile, if the list of their courses exceeds 21 (I think) an ellipsis is displayed. This seems a bit useless because... a) You can't click on the ellipsis to see the rest of the courses b) The list isn't even in alphabetic order so it becomes even more arbitrary c) the ellipsis is easy to miss, so you may not realise the list is truncated  Suggest either making this work properly, i.e., the ellipsis is clickable OR if the list is not considered important just put ""too many courses to show"" if it exceeds a certain amount. It would seem sensible to display them in alphabetic order too.  Without this it is difficult for an administrator to see all the courses a user is in if (for example) checking role assignments.",13
MDL-12403,"backup or import of single quiz includes all questions in database","When making a backup of individual quizzes, no matter how many (or how few) quizzes I back up, the backup includes all questions from the question bank, not only those used in the quiz which I'm backing up. So, in an extreme case, if I back up a single quiz, and then restore it to another course, I unintentionally transfer hundreds of questions along with this quiz.    The same happens when importing a quiz to another course.",100
MDL-13114,"Include bulk course create and remove with Moodle through the use of CSV files","We're looking to Moodle for a replacement to Blackboard Enterprise.  In order for Moodle to be a viable replacement we need a way to bulk create and delete courses based on CSV files.  The bulk create courses is handled by use of a 3rd party module (uploadcourse.php created by Rory Allford).  However once we import say 700+ courses there's no way to them bulk remove them at the end of a semester (removing 1 by 1 would be too time consuming).  We would really prefer that this functionality be included within Moodle, as relying on 3rd party modules (no matter how good they are), inherits a risk if the module stops getting updated.",100
MDL-16073,"Add ""test database setup"" to the ""External Database"" enrollment and authentication plugins","It is hard to test whether the administrative panel for External Database Authentication and for External Database Enrollment is configured correctly. Currently, you have to create fake user accounts or similar, and try to authenticate them or enroll them and see if they receive email, etc. (At least, that's how I tested it! Does someone have a better way?)    It woule be nice to have a ""Test Connection"" button on that page which goes through and makes sure all the db info (username, password, connection, etc.) and data mapping is correct.

MDL-18014,"Automatically and periodically save WYSIWYG editor content as a draft/concept","This emerged during the discussion at MDL-13370. Shortly: use AJAX to automatically and periodically (eg. every minute) save the content of a WYSIWYG editor to the concepts (drafts) space. See GMail for the working example.    It seems to me that we could use table mdl_post for this therefore not DB changes should be required. There will be a flag for a rich text field definitions that enables this feature.

MDL-18770,"Non-graded Assignment and Quizzes appear in the gradebook  and have Max Grade assigned","Non-graded Assignment and Quizzes are getting displayed in the gradebook, and they look like being included into aggregation in the Cat&Items interface, since they have Max Grade value set to 100.  Other activities behave definitely. E.g. If Forum is not graded, it does not appear in the gradebook as a column. Which for me is an expected behavior.    1. Add an Assignment. Set it to No Grade. Column will still appear in the gradebook. Now go to the Cat&Items interface. It will display Max Grade for that column to be 100 points. (Though it will not be actually included into the calculation)  2. Add an Assignment. Set it to be graded on a scale (scales are NOT included in aggregation for us). Maximum Grade in the Cat&Items interface will display some number (e.g. 3, if there are 3 items in a scale). It is confusing, since one would now expect that 3 to be calculated toward course/category total.  3. Add a quiz, add some questions, and make the quiz to be worth 0 points. Maximum Grade in the Cat&Items interface will still be 10 points (or 100). Interestingly enough, I can manually delete a gradebook column for this kind of quiz. (But, once I delete a column, there is no way for me add it back, even though I will make the quiz gradable)    I think MDL-14017 is related to this. ",13
MDL-20045,"Add unofficial support for custom context levels","This issue is in reference to http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=111362. In brief, one of our Moodle extensions would benefit greatly from being able to use Moodle's roles and contexts system, and we would need to define our own context levels.  However, we would like to be able to do this without having to differ from core in unmaintainable ways.

MDL-27158,"Default timezone is incorrect when not set in PHP configuration","When 'date.timezone' is not set in the PHP server configuration, Moodle sets the base timezone to PHP's default which is 'Asia/Jayapura'. When you then set a timezone in the administration area, to say 'Australia/Adelaide', the time is half an hour too fast. If the 'date.timezone' is set in the PHP server configuration, this is not an issue.    The problem seems to be that PHP is still thinking 'Asia/Jayapura' is the base timezone, which is GMT+9 hours. When Moodle stores the timestamp, it subtracts the 9 hours from the current time, storing a ""UTC"" timestamp value. When Moodle then goes to display a time (i.e. assignment conditional access times), it adds +9.5 hours to the timestamp which gives the incorrect time.    When using ""Server's local time"", it works fine and there is no issue either. However, if Moodle is set to use ""Server's local time"", and then a user manually sets their timezone, it is again incorrect.

MDL-31410,"PayPal IPN Script exposed to message_send() failure","The below issue includes the resolution. It merely needs to be marked as fixed and merged in to the main development branch.    The ipn.php script, that is a part of the Paypal enrolment method, makes calls to a function ""message_send"" that can cause the entire PayPal enrolment method to fail.    The ipn script is called by PayPal when a payment has been processed. Paypal calls the script and passes various tokens regarding the transaction. The ipn script:    1) Opens a handle for the paypal connection  2) Evaluates the received tokens and validates them  3) Enrols a student accordingly  4) Notifies the student, instructors & admins via a call to ""message_send()""  5) Closes the connection from paypal    Various people have been reporting that their paypal enrolments work fine for a while, but they start getting these IPN failure warning messages from Paypal. In their IPN history in Paypal, they see a list of failed transactions where the server (moodle) response was a 404.    What's happening for these people, is the 4th step above is failing. The ipn script dies as a product of message_send() failing and the PHP server process would seem to time out and cause the web server to return a 404 to paypal. Since step 3 has been completed, end users of moodle are getting what they need from the plugin. However Paypal doesn't tolerate the 404 responses for long and automatically disables IPN messaging after a while - causing paypal enrolments to fail entirely.    The solution I'm proposing is really simple. I've modified ipn.php to use a wrapper function for message_send that puts the call in try-catch block. This insulates the execution of ipn.php from whatever message_send failures ruining the whole experience. I believe resolving the issue in message_send is another matter (and may merely be a misconfiguration thing - though myself and others do have systems that send us emails successfully, guess those situations aren't depending on the same function).    I've attached my modified version of ipn.php below. I hope it is immediately merged in to the main development branch as this is probably affecting even more people than have been complaining about it.

MDL-31560,"New message_send API is incapable of sending notfications from the $CFG->noreplyaddress.","The old email_to_user API could do this, and we need to be able to do this in many places in the code that currently use email_to_user, and which should be updated to message_send in future.    Please extend the API to make this possible. The old system was able to set a fake name to go beside the $CFG->noreplyaddress, so for example you might get emails from  * Shy User <noreply@moodle.org> - for example when a forum poster has decided they want to keep their email private; or  * Quiz system <noreply@moodle.org> - for emails generated in code.    I think both these use-cases are important, and so need to be implemented in the API, but from what I can see, this will be hard because:  * messages can hang around for some time in the message_working table - that is, there is no guarantee that messages are sent synchronously - it is up to the message output plugins.  * The from address in the message table is stored as a userid in a NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 column.

MDL-31776,"Additional name fields, to allow Asian languages to flexibly display user names in Chinese characters, local phonetic system or Romanization","h3. Alternate name fields  *This is a proposal on behalf of The Moodle Association of Japan (http://moodlejapan.org). We are willing to work closely with Moodle HQ on this improvement and help by providing some funding for its development.*  The standard Moodle has only two fields for names ""firstname"" and ""lastname"". In countries that use a different writing system, this means that two sets of names need to be displayed, their name in the local writing system and their name in Romanization. Moodle needs a way to input both types of names, and for both the individual and the administrator (and perhaps at the course level) to determine which names appear in the various Moodle contexts.   *An ideal configuration*  I propose three additional fields: *surnamephon givenphon alternatename*   For standard English and European usage, these would be ignored, but for Japanese, Chinese, Korean and perhaps other writing systems such as Thai, the various Indian languages and Arabic. Possible entries would look like this:    || ||lastname||firstname||lastphon||firstphon||Alternate|| |Japanese|佐藤|宏|サトウ|ヒロシ|Satou Hiroshi| |Korean|李 |奎報| 이|규보|Yi Gyubo| |Chinese|陳|美和|ㄔㄣ|ㄇㄟㄏㄨㄚ|Chen MeiHua|   The site administrator would select how the $FULLNAME variable would appear. For Japanese, for example, the administrator might select lastname + firstname + alternate so that the students' names would appear in Kanji, but with the Romanization of it following the Kanji.  This would allow everyone to know how the name should be pronounced.  (Even Japanese need this since there are alternate pronunciations for Kanji. ""神部"" for example, could be read as ""Kamibe"" or ""Kambe"" depending on the preference of the user's family.)   Any combination of the above could also be selected as the default for user names that appear in various tables.  If the selected fields for tables is one of the Asian phonetic fields, then rather than the standard alphabet display for filtering the list by first name and last name, a similar selection display would appear for the selected alphabetic system.  For Chinese, a selection would also need to be made for the phonetic system to use.  Taiwan uses the ""BoPoMoFo"" (Zhuyin) system, while mainland China uses the Pinyin system.  *Student ID Display*  For many Asian languages, another problem not encountered so much in the West is people with identical names. This, plus the fact that some of the languages (namely Japanese and Chinese) have no convenient method for ordering names in Chinese characters, means that most schools rely on the student ID for ordering and identifying students rather than (or in addition to) their names.  Thus, there should also be an option in the site set-up selecting the StudentID field to be displayed to the left of names on various listings such as the grade book, assignment evaluation, etc.  *Complexity & coding time:*  This problem is quite complex since it involves modifying core code in perhaps 50-100 files that do database I/O, table displays, preference selections, etc. and would need to be done in close coordination with Moodle Headquarters.  *Who would benefit from this improvement?:* Probably every institution in Asia that has staff who do not read the local language need to be able to display names in both the local language and Roman letters. Various, rather unsatisfactory ad hoc solutions are currently used but a permanent, more elegant solution is urgently needed. ",100

By accepting an iterator you can pass in a whole array, or a recordset (to avoid storing all the data to be inserted in memory).    Although it works in simple cases I'm finding that there are quite a few subtleties in the depths of dmllib and to make it work with all field types and databases I think some core dml changes might be needed.

How to reproduce:  (Compare & Contrast)  In 1.9  1)Create an online text assignment and ensure ""comment inline"" is checked  2)Log in with a student account and type in some text  3)Log back in with teacher account and verify that the student's text is included in your feedback  box so you could if wished edit/highlight their words  In 2.3:  1)Create a new assignment  2)Ensure ""online text"" is set to Yes and ""Feedback comments"" are set to Yes  3) Log in with student account and type some text  4) Log back in as a teacher and verify the students' text does NOT appear in feedback box; therefore you can't scribble all over it like in exercise books :(",8

MDL-34744,"MSSQL backup fails under some circumstances","We encountered the problem when our automated backups weren't running properly; they'd get stuck part way through. Trying to backup the courses the auto backup got stuck at gave us the same problem.    Certain  big courses (in the sense of lots of resources, not filesize) don't backup up properly either manually or through the automated system. The backup process just ran until it gets a fastcgi error. We tried to see if we could narrow it down to particular types of resources, but that wasn't it. As an example, one course which wouldn't backup had a category level question bank with 1000+ questions.    I did a lot of unsuccessful troubleshooting, which I've not reported-- here's where we're at now, hopefully it's useful to someone. Please note that the changes I detail below are NOT A FIX, they were done for troubleshooting, using them in production introduces other problems:    Tracing the backup process we found the problem would always occur in the   backup_structure_dbops.class.php file     in the     function move_annotations_to_final($backupid, $itemname)     within the     $DB->set_field('backup_ids_temp', 'itemname', $itemname . 'final', array('id' => $annotation->id));     call.    Adding traces here shows it ticking along fine but then just stopping. Multiple attempts to backup the same course (after waiting for cron to clear out temp stuff) ended up failing at the same point.    Tracing deeper into the set_field function, it calls the sqlsrv do_query,     To troubleshoot, I added a query timeout as follows (none was specified originally)  In sqlsrv_native_moodle_database function do_query   $result = sqlsrv_query($this->sqlsrv, $sql,array(),array('QueryTimeout'=>10));    the backups now return with error  Debug info: SQLState: HYT00<br>  Error Code: 0<br>  Message: [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 10.0]Query timeout expired<br>  UPDATE #mdl_backup_ids_temp SET itemname = N'filefinal' WHERE id = '1366'  [array (  0 => 'filefinal',  1 => '1366',  )]  Stack trace:  •line 397 of \lib\dml\moodle_database.php: dml_write_exception thrown  •line 252 of \lib\dml\sqlsrv_native_moodle_database.php: call to moodle_database->query_end()  •line 370 of \lib\dml\sqlsrv_native_moodle_database.php: call to sqlsrv_native_moodle_database->query_end()  •line 1098 of \lib\dml\sqlsrv_native_moodle_database.php: call to sqlsrv_native_moodle_database->do_query()  •line 1475 of \lib\dml\moodle_database.php: call to sqlsrv_native_moodle_database->set_field_select()  •line 146 of \backup\util\dbops\backup_structure_dbops.class.php: call to moodle_database->set_field()  •line 1338 of \backup\moodle2\backup_stepslib.php: call to backup_structure_dbops::move_annotations_to_final()  •line 34 of \backup\util\plan\backup_execution_step.class.php: call to move_info  ref_annotations_to_final->define_execution()  •line 153 of \backup\util\plan\base_task.class.php: call to backup_execution_step->execute()  •line 148 of \backup\util\plan\base_plan.class.php: call to base_task->execute()  •line 105 of \backup\util\plan\backup_plan.class.php: call to base_plan->execute()  •line 296 of \backup\controller\backup_controller.class.php: call to backup_plan->execute()  •line 111 of \backup\util\ui\backup_ui.class.php: call to backup_controller->execute_plan()  •line 89 of \backup\backup.php: call to backup_ui->execute()    Varying the timeout had no effect; it failed at the same place, just would take longer...  So adding the timeout here gets the backup process to fail after the timeout (rather than waiting for a fastcgi timeout). It looks like mssql just not responding.    I wanted to see what was happening with the tables, which is hard for mssql and temp tables, since they're session based. I don't have access to the moodle db sessions' temp tables from my db admin tool.    To get around this, I modified \backup\util\dbops\backup_controller_dbops_class.php (around line 141&150), so that a real table was created/deleted, instead of using MSSQLs session based temp tables (just removed ""_temp_"" in the calls to dbman, ie   $dbman->create_temp_table($xmldb_table); becomes  $dbman->create_table($xmldb_table);   and around 150   $dbman->drop_temp_table($table); becomes  $dbman->drop_table($table);    There's a similar fix neccessary in   \backup\util\dbops\restore_controller_dbops_class.php, line 109,     With this change, the backup and restore work ok.     My hypothesis is that at some point during the long backup, another connection gets made to mssql; since temp tables are associated with connections, the link to the original temp table gets lost and the data isn't available. Of course this doesn't explain why the sqlsrv call ust times out rather than returning an error.    We've actually been using the system with this little change, but it's not really satisfactory -- the problem, of course, is that only one backup/restore can be run on the system at any one time because there's just the one temp table; and multiple backups just conflict, requiring the temp table we created to be dropped.

Test with a variety of screen readers. Explicitly set each table data cell's row and column headers.    *edit 28/Aug/2014:*  Unable to reproduce identified behaviour now that the UCLA code has been integrated. Some improvements to accessibility have been implemented under this issue, namely:  * Top left cell(s) have been replaced with a single cell with rowspan that contains a label only visible to screen readers, namely {{get_string('participants')}}; scope has been set to col to make it relate to the three or more columns it sits above.  * Header attributes removed from *grade report cell* and *email cell*; the only ""header"" for a row is the participant's name cell.    This results in better behaviour; when prompted about a given cell, a screen reader reads first the column information (category / course, then activity title), followed by row information (user's name only), followed by the contents of the cell. Given that the floating user panel only contains the user's name, this should be an acceptable tradeoff.    Note that a lot of elements within these cells do not yet have their appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g. the user picture); this will be addressed in MDL-46662.    *Changes, mostly to ""left"" cells generated by get_left_rows():*  # Top-left filler cells  #* Amended logic to generate a single big filler cell using {{rowspan}}, instead of multiple stacked filler cells.  #* Set {{scope}} attribute to target columns below.  #* Added a {{span}} to hold a label for said columns, using lang string {{participants}}.  # User rows  #* Moved {{header}} class onto first column  #* Added {{rowheader}} class to first column  #* Changed all other columns to be {{td}} s rather than {{th}} s so screen readers don't count them as ""row headers""  #* Hid user avatars from screen readers  # Activity headers  #* Hid activity icons from screen readers",20

MDL-36034,"pre-cache active filters for course categories to significantly reduce database queries","On Moodles that have a lot of course categories, and a filter enabled for content and headings (e.g. multilang), there are currently excessively many database queries being made (e.g. 1 per course category).  For example, if you have 500 course categories, which is often the case for large institutions, you will have > 500 queries on course/index.php or course/category.php.  The database queries are caused by a call to get the context instance for each course category.  I've coded something in the branch https://github.com/brki/moodle/tree/mdl23-preload-filters-for-course-categories . The commit https://github.com/brki/moodle/commit/da23cce06d7edbd2cad43ba9c25396dcf5bfac35 preloads all the course category context instances for course/index.php and course/category.php.

This customer site has about half a dozen very large courses, where the backup system generates vary large files (two examples from the test I ran this morning are 7.8GB and 9.2GB).  These are obviously too large to be successfully zipped, and when the backup processes them, it eventually fails with the error like : ""Error - backup-moodle2-course-1681-20130205-1034.mbz does not appear to be a valid backup (missing_moodle_backup_xml_file)""    Then (in the log) it says ""complete - next execution (the next scheduled backup time)""    So it fails, presumably because it is too big - but then carries on.  This in itself is good, as previously, failures like this were stopping the backup schedule completely.    However, the next time that the scheduled course backup is run, all of the old versions of the backups are replaced (remember, we are only keeping one of each) EXCEPT the failed backups.  Moodle does not seem to recognise them as valid backups, despite their filenames, so they are NOT deleted.  Over the course of several days, the multiple copies of large failed backups that result from this eventually fill up the server disk, and cause teh site to fail.    I know that this relates to the larger subject of handling very large course backups, but can anything be done with the checking process, so that these large failed backup files do not get left to fill up the server?

That's a pretty big deal for Moodlerooms, where our largest site has nearly 445,000 course sections, and an average of over 6,000 course sections across 1,200 sites.

MDL-38561,"Convert filepickers and filemanagers to YUI modules","These are a little broken, as discussed in MDL-38515.    core_filepicker describes a file in /repository/filepicker.js which adds a YUI module called moodle-core_filepicker.

So in order to get this to work, core_filepicker depends on moodle-core_filepicker.  The inclusion of core_filepicker means that the JS file itself is included, and then the contents of it's YUI module are handled by our legacy code having it depend on it's own module.    This is really really broken and needs to be fixed as it prevents us from detecting and reporting other issues.    My suggested fix is to go over the existing code and convert all of the bits to appropriate YUI modules.

This simplifies the interface for users.    2) If an activity module has two or more subtypes, then promote the module in the UI to a group equal to ""Activities"" or ""Resources"".

We can leave tinymce as the default - but use this editor on iOS spcifically where tinyMCE fails.  2.

Things to do:    Change the name? - done - rename to ""HTML5 text editor""    Change the icons? - only for consistency. Can be done when icons are ready.

MDL-41447,"Upgrading from 1.9 to 2.2 (en-route to 2.4.5) has errors with certain kinds of URL link","We had a customer site running 1.9.19.  They had (in most of their courses) a file link resource to an uploaded html file at the top of the course, a big file of instructions in many sections, and then further down in each topic section they had a file/website link resource to the same uploaded file, but specifying an anchor in the file, so that the learner could click on this resource and be taken to the relevant part of the big html file.    So those resources all ended with the same filename, like this: /path/to/file/instructions.html#3    The #3 (or whatever number) opened the html file and scrolled down to the relevant anchor.    If you run a moodle upgrade on this site from 1.9 to 2.2 (which *has* to be done before going to 2.4) then the main uploaded file link resource converts correctly, but the resources containing links to specific anchors in that html file start to convert as file links (rather than website links) and then fail, because the file instructions.html#3 (or whatever) does not exist.    This particular customer site ended up with about 1400 broken resources, all of them of the above type - a link to an uploaded html file with the anchor number specified on the file link.    I know that 1.9 and 2.2 are no longer officially reported, but we, in common no doubt with a lot of partners, still have quite a number of 1.9 sites to upgrade, and if we come across this kind of resource link again, and the conversion process does not handle the resource correctly we end up with potentially hundreds or thousands of broken resources to fix.

Right now the registration of shutdown handlers (register_shutdown_function) is completely chaotic and disorganized, and that can lead to more and more problems where some objects, not available anymore, or disposed by a previous handler are needed later in the chain of shutdowns.    {code}  grep -lr register_shutdown_function *  {code}    So we need some method to organize and force their registration in an ordered way, declaring their needs (DB, logging, whatever) and observing any dependencies between them and also, surely containing references to all the needed used to avoid its auto-disposal by php.

In Moodle we don't have AJAX login, and we have mitigated against the https -> http issue by always setting the wwwroot to the current schema.    However, it would be really super nice if we *could* have AJAX login, and I don't feel that the reasons which once prevented forced use of HTTPS throughout a site are as strong as they used to be. Hardware performance is far better than it was five years ago; it's been [proven how easy it is to steal sessions from non-ssl|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep] so these things are no longer theoretical or even hard; and SSL is far more widespread.    As it is, we already load all additional content (e.g. CSS, JS, image) over SSL so it's now just the actual page content which is not.    We no longer have issues with third-party plugins not supporting SSL (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc).    I'd like to propose that we drop support for loginhttps.

MDL-42904,"Self enrolment by group key does not work - until group settings are saved again","We have a customer running on Moodle 2.5.2.  They are setting up courses using group enrolment keys.    I have checked their configuration and it seems correct.    If a user attempts to self-enrol on one of these courses, using the correct group key, the receive the error ""Incorrect enrolment key, please try again"".    But the key *is* correct.  I have tested this myself.    The weird thing is that if you go into the groups page, select the relevant group and choose ""edit group settings"", then press save (without changing anything at all) then the user can self-enrol.    It is as if the group key details have not been properly saved the first time they were set up...although the key has certainly been saved, as you can click the ""unmask"" checkbox, and the correct key is displayed.  The customer can't go through the whole site, hundreds of courses, editing and clicking save on every group in every course.    I cannot find anything wrong with the site configuration, the self-enrolment plugin configuration, or the group configuration.  It seems to me that this is a bug, although I'd be happy to be proved wrong as long as an explanation of this behaviour is forthcoming.    I'd appreciate someone taking a look at this as a matter of urgency - I can arrange access to the site and server if required.",8
MDL-42909,"Move (non-JS): title attribute is on wrong tag","When you are moving items (using the non-AJAX version), the move targets are written out using code like the following:    {code}  <li class=""first movehere"" title=""Move 'AA306 discussion' to this location"">  <a href=""https://learn2acct.open.ac.uk/course/mod.php?movetosection=149146&sesskey=666"">  <img class=""movetarget"" src=""https://learn2acct.open.ac.uk/theme/image.php/ou/core/1383320278/movehere"" title=""Move to here"" alt=""Move to here"">  </a>  </li>  {code}    As you can see, there is a title attribute on the LI tag which does not make a lot of sense. It should be on the link tag. (Additionally, there is an unnecessary title attribute on the img tag.)    This was caused by MDL-37085.    The previous code was:    {code}  <a title=""Move 'AA306 discussion' to this location"" href=""https://learn2.open.ac.uk/course/mod.php?moveto=287791&amp;sesskey=666""><img class=""movetarget"" src=""https://learn2.open.ac.uk/theme/image.php/ou/core/1382685195/movehere"" alt=""Move to here""></a>  {code}    This code is correct, with a title attribute on the A tag containing the full text, and an alt attribute (no title) on the IMG tag.    For accessibility reasons, none of these titles are suitable anyway. All links should have different texts so while the longer text includes the name of the item being moved, that doesn't actually help as it's still the same for all of them. An accessible solution would use text like:    'Move item to Week 4 before ""Study resources""'    In other words, I didn't describe the item being moved (because they probably know, and it's the same for all of them) but I included the section name of the target location and a relative before/after for the position within that section.    I am not sure whether or not it is worth doing anything about this because I know Moodle HQ is planning to stop supporting the non-JS graceful degradation features. I was thinking about fixing the regression and putting it back to have the right attribute on the right tag, but since it's inaccessible even after doing that (and always was), I don't think I am going to bother...    So probably just filing this bug and leave it for Moodle staff to decide what to do, sorry!    The offending code where it puts the title on the li is course/renderer.php in course_section_cm_list, currently line 1097/1106, btw.  ",5

MDL-42928,"Reimplement scroll locking for full-screen dialogues","IMO, this is a serious usability issue as many of our dialogues contain scrollable content. When these are open and you attempt to scroll, you'll find that the page scrolls too.    Whilst this isn't a major issue for desktop computers, those using trackpads (predominantly laptops), and those with touch screens (predominantly tablets) who swipe to get down the list will find that the whole page starts to move once the bottom (or top) of the list is reached.    In the case of the Activity Chooser, this is a serious regression.    This patch re-introduces scroll locking but using a different method. Rather than removing the scrollbars, we instead set the scrollTop and scrollLeft to the positions they were in when the dialogue was opened. We do this on every scroll event.  When the dialogue is closed, we stop forcing the scroll and release control back to the user.",100

We believe that this may be an issue.    We have spent a while talking about this and feel that the {{groups_get_all_groups()}} function should also pass the activity's groupingid value so that, if a grouping has been selected, the potential graders are restricted to users within the activity's grouping.    This should be a case of simply changing the line to   {code}  if ($groups = groups_get_allgroups($this->get_course()->id, $userid, $this->get_course_module()->groupingid) {  {code}    Like I said we have spent a while talking about this and we can't see the reason why this works the way it does, so we would also welcome someone explaining why it is the way it is!",3

Create a manual grade item in the Gradebook.  2.  Enter a formula in the grade item, referring to another grade item, such as =SUM([[X]],[[Y]]).  3.  Then delete one of the grade items that are referred to in the aforementioned formula, e.g. delete the grade item referred to as ""X"".  4.  Examine the formula; it should now have a ## token indicating that it is pointing to a non-existent grade item.  5.  Edit the grade item and change the value of ""Grade type"" from ""Value"" to ""None""  6.  Examine the Gradebook - THE ITEM HAS NOW DISAPPEARED FROM THE GRADEBOOK GUI.  7.

This is a pretty good implementation, but there are 2 problems with it.     1/ The full mathjax library is hundreds of megabytes (fonts) - it's just too big to include the whole thing in Moodle. So - some fonts were stripped etc to keep the size of that one down - and it was still over 30MB. An alternative is to use the CDN mathjax library by default - and provide a method to download and install the full version into moodledata for people who require it (firewall/proxy etc).    2/ It does things properly (moodley) by wrapping the mathjax library a yui module and including it from the footer. This means that the loading of mathjax does not block the rest of the page displaying. The downside is that the alternative method of installing mathjax is to link to it in additionalhtmlhead. This includes mathjax earlier, so the equations on the page are rendered earlier - and some people prefer that option. Maybe there is an alternative way of including it that will load it earlier.    3/ However it is loaded/linked etc. In the forum samples I have seen, it is linked to from the head with almost a default configuration.

The problem only occurs in forms where the submitted value is being set as the initial value for the field when the form fails validation and is being redisplayed. Someone could potentially insert something malicious in the value field and have it executed when the page returns.    The reason we don't think this is exploitable is that it seems that the malicious code can only originate and execute on the same client.    However we did note that the Chrome XSS-Auditor blocked the code from executing ""because [the script's] source code was found within the request"".    We had a look to see where the problem is. It appears to be with the way the values for these form elements are filtered when server side validation of the form has failed. ""getCleanType"" is returning ""cleanhtml"" and ""raw"" for the editor and filemanager elements, respectively. ""clean_param"" with type PARAM_CLEANHTML is being applied to all three of the parameters for the editor, ""description_editor[text]"", ""description_editor[format]"" and ""description_editor[itemid]"", while the ""itemid"" and ""format"" parameters seem to only even contain integers. ""imagefile"" is being cleaned with type PARAM_RAW (the default when no setType has been specified).    This could be a problem with other form element types - any element where setType is not specified, or when an insufficient filter type is specified and the field is not cleaned in some other way before being sent back to the client when there is a validation error.",8

MDL-44002,"Decide upon intended screen reader support","Each of the Screen Readers we've come across seem to do things their way, and have differing levels of support for:  * different accessibility features;  * browsers; and  * operating systems    We need to determine which screen reader(s) we intend to make Moodle work best with in order to choose the most optimal solution for these readers.    Our selection also has a big impact upon the amount of time it requires to develop new functionality and changes, and to test it.    From the compatibility matrix I've created so far (http://goo.gl/b4cVb5), there are approximately 30 combinations of screen reader + browser + operating system available to users.    h4. Considerations    Ideally, this should be as few combinations as possible because as we add each combination, the complexity increases dramatically, as does the time required for development and testing.    The ideal solution would be for a single, well documented, well tested, and widely available screenreader, but as http://goo.gl/b4cVb5 shows, this will not be possible as no screen reader supports both Windows, Macintosh, and Linux whilst providing support for multiple browsers.    Whilst Mobile support would be desirable, I think initially we should focus on improving the support for desktop screen readers as a priority and look at adding mobile combinations later.    h4. Options    Data suggests that the most widely used _primary_ Reader by far is *Jaws* [1] though it's usage has seen rapid decline over the past few years.    Jaws is followed in popularity by Windows-Eyes, and Apple's Voiceover.    ChromeVox is the only screen reader we've come across to support the same browser across multiple operating systems which may also be an important consideration for some users. At present its market share is low (0.2% [1]) but it is new to the arena - from what I can tell it was only released in February 2012 [2] with the survey taking place in May 2012.    NVDA, which came in at fourth place in the webaim survey is also an interesting option as it is the highest ranked free solution for Windows, though it is only compatible with Windows and the Firefox + IE browsers.    h4. Recommendations    To offer the most widespread selection it makes sense to choose from the following subset of screen readers.    I have not, at this stage, commented on the ease of development for each screen reader at present, or it's comparative support for various accessiblity functionality.    h5. Jaws  Pros:  * High market penetration    Cons:  * Cost to users  * Windows only  * Internet Explorer only    h5. NVDA  Pros:  * Free  * Mid-level market penetration    Cons:  * Windows only  * Firefox and Internet Explorer only    h5. OS X VoiceOver  Pros:  * Free  * Supports all browsers tested  * Also available on iOS    Cons:  * Mac OS Only    h5. ChromeVox  Pros:  * Free  * Cross-Operating system    Cons:  * Google Chrome only      h4.

Current problem  Problem is that we cannot just falsify log history by injecting log records from the restore file, events must be always triggered and we need to know where are the courses coming from, that means the restore process needs to log everything that is happening during restore.    * import (=== backup+restore) of activities should not try to restore any logs  * restore from different site cannot create log entries with non-existent users  * duplication of course (restore into new course) may bork stats  * statistics should probably ignore the events coming from restore completely      h2. Possible solutions    h3. A/ use events    1/ trigger \core\event\restore_started and \core\event\restore_finished events (this might be useful in any case)  2/ log writers would watch for these and start adding 'restore' origin when writing events to storage during the restore process    h3. B/ new $PAGE->get_request_origin()    The idea is to have one method that tells you if you are doing something from normal page, ws, cli, restore. The restore code would use some private API to tell PAGE that restore starts/end or it could even use 1/, but that would require a new observer which does not seem optimal to me. At the same time we could add $PAGE->get_request_ip().    After A/ or B/ is implemented we could filter out logs coming from the restore process in stats and other areas where we want to ignore the events triggered during restore.    The next step would be to optionally restore the original log data - we would need backup/restore support in log stores and new method in base event class which would have to be overridden by events that can recalculate the ids.

MDL-44164,"Refactor Atto code","I've put together a (mostly) working PoC to restructure the atto code.    At present, the code is based around a structure which must be aware of every editor on the page. We have to pass around an elementid, and each plugin adds buttons to their own element, but with a single click handler.    The code also does not meet the coding style guidelines.    IMO, we need to refactor this to:  * not pass around the elementid;  * comply with coding style requirements;  * include API documentation to assist plugin developers;  * have one editor instance per editor;  * have instances of the plugins on each editor rather than globally.    This will:  * make our lives far easier in the future to maintain because we'll be reducing the code duplication;  * allow people to write plugins more easily and with much less code duplication;  * which will allow for a greater diversity of plugins in a shorter period;  * give better confidence from third-party developers writing plugins for the new editor, and as a result the community as a whole (just think how much we've complained about the TinyMCE plugin structure).    Personally, I feel that this needs to be done before integration, and certainly before release.

Damyon: I think this is not a blocker (it could be an improvement, but to decide on the best functionality, is difficult as there will be differing opinions. I agree that a consistent order makes things easier to ""learn"" (so they can be repeated quickly). This will be improved by having keyboard shortcuts.

This way you can style a button and instantly have the look updated across other components like search forms containing buttons.    *Elements and components can be complex*  Elements don't need to be easy to write - they should be feature full and limited in number. Developers should not write components instead they should be re-using the available elements and components.    *Overriding a render to change how an element must be both easy and robust*  Re-use is key as per the above point.  However we need to achieve this in such a way that we don't introduce magic and keep things simple to understand and override.  We have to be able to deal with state and attribute requirements of the element in relation to its parent component and do it in such as way that the state is owned by the component and attributes are owner by the render method. and keep it all understandable.

MDL-45893,"Developing a User Menu","Adding a User Menu, in the bootstrapbase themes; refer to the specification to know what it should contain, and how to implement it.    The general approach here is to refactor the existing navbar's capabilities, allowing it to support multiple dropdowns without adversely affecting existing DOM structure (which would necessitate every theme re-targeting its styles).    Update 10/06/2014: The user menu is being rendered fine, but the current solution doesn't quite encapsulate everything that'll need to happen with the navbar; in particular, page_heading_menu() stuff isn't handled by this solution as it doesn't really make sense for that stuff to live in a dropdown.    Update 24/06/2014: Okay, this turned out to be huge.    - The new {{user_menu}} renderable is an extension of the {{custom_menu}} renderable, constructed with references to a user, a course, a page and an array of flags (at present, the only thing that makes sense to set _a priori_ is {{guest}}, a boolean flag).  -- Basing the new renderable on the {{custom_menu}} allows for it to be easily displayed in Base-based themes as well.  -- A minor bug in {{custom_menu}}'s YUI3 dropdown code was fixed: in brief, the logic was looking for a dropdown attribute on the node that was clicked (e.target) instead of the node that the event was actually wired to (e.currentTarget).  - {{custom_menu}} renderables have been extended by way of MDL-46022 and have also gained the ability to assign CSS suffix flags to {{custom_menu_item}}s - which is necessary for us to avoid having to hardcode icons into the renderer PHP.  - In order to support multiple collapsible menus, it was necessary to create an entire {{bootstrap_navbar}} renderable which renders the {{body > header}} element and renders out a collection of menus. Bootstrap javascript has been patched to allow for multiple navbar items.  - Responsive styles have been provided.",100

That in turn handles the backup process looking at each page.    At each page, it uses the following to fill in the form:  {code}  $this->fill_backup_restore_form($options);  {code}    Which then looks for each option in the table and fills it in. Since most of those settings are only found on one page, we then wait 12 seconds for the search for that option to fail to be found (which we ignore with a try/catch).    https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/backup/util/ui/tests/behat/behat_backup.php#L351    The result is that each test involving backups takes a good minute just to fill in the each page of the backup form, for three pages making about 3 minutes of wasted time in timeouts.

A simple solution:    Use cohorts to represent the departments, and allow each cohort to be mapped to one course category and one theme.    Then, once a user has logged in, we know which cohorts they are in, and this which categories they are allowed in, and then we restrict the entire course tree to just show those categories (and anything inside them).  If there is just one category then we could further refine this by leaving out the name of the category and putting the contents of it at the top level.    There don't have to be any further changes in enrolments, and if the user is also enrolled in any courses outside this category then these courses will simply appear in the list of My courses at the top level.    Additionally, if they are in just ONE cohort (or all their cohorts have the same theme) we also set the theme to match (this cohort theme setting overrides all other theme settings).

In iOS versions < 8, the scroll event is only fired at the end of the action, and not throughout so this is not an issue.  From iOS 8 (tested with beta 4 on Safari), the scroll event is fired throughout. However, it is not fired frequently enough, resulting in a stuttering feeling.    IE just sucks at tables and with a large table in the DOM, it stutters without any javascript at all. Adding the floating headers makes this more apparent for the same reason that iOS 8 appears to stutter - the scroll event is not called frequently enough, and it looks like it's stuttering as a result.    We've tried several fixes for this already, and at present the code is highly optimised so that the fewest number of calculations occurs. The code also batches UI changes to reduce layout thrashing.    In one sense, it would be nice to use a position of fixed, but this has it's own issues too:  * iOS has a long-standing known issue where fixed items gradually disappear off the screen.

Very simple example:    ||Grade item||Max grade||Natural Weight||  | Assign 1 | 10 | 10 % |  | Assign 2 | 20 | 20 % |  | Assign 3 | 30 | 30 % |  | Assign 4 | 40 | 40 % |  Total = 100  If item 2 is excluded because the student has not submitted anything and ""exclude empty grades"" is enabled -   ||Grade item||Max grade||Natural Weight||  | Assign 1 | 10 | 12.5 % |  | Assign 3 | 30 | 37.5 % |  | Assign 4 | 40 | 50 % |  Total = 80    Further more - currently we recalculate the ""view"" if show totals excluding hidden items is enabled. Depending on the performance of recalculating all of the above at page load time - we may need to add additional columns to store the ""view"" for users without view hidden grades capability. (This would be 3 extra columns on grade_grade)            Older - more complicated description:    At the moment, excluded and empty grades not being calculated in the final grade, is not enabled with sum of grades (the basis of natural weights). Also currently we have not introduced code to handle displaying hidden grades in the reports.     To do:    # Update reports to not consider empty grades. This work will be partially solved by MDL-47078.  # Update reports to exclude hidden grade items. Please note that hidden grade items are items hidden to all students and doesn't cover conditional access to activities.    Examples : (Please note that this is the desired outcome)  *Exclude empty grades*  Student 1  ||Grade item||Grade||Percent||  | Assign 1 | 10 / 20 | 50 % |  | Assign 2 | 10 / 40 | 5 % |  | Assign 3 | - / 80 | - |  | Total | 20 / 60 | 33.33 % |    Student 2  ||Grade item||Grade||Percent||  | Assign 1 | - / 20 | - |  | Assign 2 | - / 40 | - |  | Assign 3 | 20 / 80 | 25% |  | Total | 20 / 80 | 25.00 % |    Student 1 20 (33.00%)  Student 2 20 (25.00 %)    *Exclude hidden grade items*  Student 1  ||Grade item||Grade||Percent||  | Assign 1 | 10 / 20 | 50 % |  | Assign 2 - hidden | - / 40 | - |  | Assign 3 | 40 / 80 | 50% |  | Total | 50 / 100 | 50.00 % |    Student 2  ||Grade item||Grade||Percent||  | Assign 1 | 15 / 20 | 75% |  | Assign 2 - hidden | - / 40 | - |  | Assign 3 | 20 / 80 | 25% |  | Total | 35 / 100 | 35.00 % |    Student 1 20 (50.00%)  Student 2 20 (35.00 %)    *Additional technical information:*    https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-46139 introduced a field, grade_grade::aggregationweight that may be helpful.    Currently, grade_category::auto_update_weights() adjust grade_item weights but does this trickle down to grade_grades?

MDL-51024,"Create a new page that can migrate a set of courses from one competency framework to another","The use case is for updating to a newer curriculum, but leaving already completed competencies un-modified.    The workflow would be to either duplicate the old framework and make changes to it, or create a new one and import from file, then choose which courses should be moved to the new framework and trigger a script that will look for competencies that exist in both frameworks (matched on idnumber) and update the course / activity competencies to point to the new framework. This process should produce a report of competencies that were mapped, competencies that could not be mapped, as well as new competencies that did not exist in the old framework.

Up to 4 levels are supported, and the name for each level can be set from the following list: Domain, Competency, Behaviour, Indicator, Outcome, Level, Concept, Value, Practice, Skill, Proficiency""    These will be provided by language strings, so they can be displayed in different languages (not taken from user input).    All other screens should replace the word ""Competency"" and ""Competencies"" with the correct term depending on the depth of the competency.    The number of terms will be fetched from a method in the framework class, just to ensure that later on we can change this number, or make it match a configuration variable. The term levels can either be saved in 4 columns, or in 1 column (_taxonomies_) with serialised data. The serialised data is less flexible but it seems unlikely that we will need to fetch just 1 term, or filter per term without loading the framework object.    The terms are using constants and will be mapped to language strings, e.g.:    {noformat}  const TAXONOMY_DOMAIN = 'domain';  const TAXONOMY_COMPETENCY = 'competency';  <lang_string> public function get_taxonomy($level);  <lang_string> public static function get_taxonomy_for_term($constant);  {noformat}",3

The same applies to templates, when the template is hidden it can not be selected to create a plan from that template.    There is no security risks attached to this issue, which means that the functions listing the frameworks and templates use an optional argument to filter out the invisible template/frameworks. Everyone can list hidden frameworks/templates but the UI will only display the relevant ones (visible). Crafting a request will report the hidden frameworks/templates, and that's fine.    However, the methods that are linking competencies to a framework/template should first check that the competency is not part of a hidden framework, in which case it cannot be linked. The method creating a plan from a template will perform the same check to ensure that the template is visible.    Note that if a framework/template is hidden after the competency/plan was created nothing happens. The hidden option is just there to act as a draft/archived flag to only display the relevant options in the UI. If the competency/plan was already created then it remains visible regardless of the status of its origin.    At a later stage we may decide to rename _visible_ to something more relevant. Or to have a _status_ on the framework/template (draft, active, archived). In that case a framework/template would have to be made ""Active"" to be visible in the relevant UI, and it could not be sent back as draft when used. Later maybe.",3

MDL-54751,"Recycle Bin - deleting large complex objects forces user to wait","With the recycle bin enabled, deleting large, complex objects forces the user to wait until the backup process has completed before they can do anything else. When you delete small objects (e.g., labels, simple pages), the deletion occurs quickly. By ""deletion,"" I mean this workflow:    1.  Turn editing on  2.  Delete item  3.  Turn editing off    But when you delete a larger, complex object, step 3 above -- turning editing off -- can take a long time ( up to > 2 minutes), and there is no indication (other than what the browser provides) that something is happening. You basically have to wait for it to finish. Something that used to happen immediately -- turning editing off after deleting something (regardless of its complexity) -- can take minutes with the Recycle Bin enabled. An example of a ""large, complex object"" is a quiz with 95 questions and 155 student responses. Obviously, Moodle is working on backing up the quiz, and since it's rather complex (lots of responses), it takes time. The same thing happens on restore. Restoring this kind of quiz can take some time, but there isn't any kind of progress indicator to let the user know that something is happening and that it may take some time.    The concern here is that with the recycle bin enabled, a fundamental aspect of the Moodle experience has changed; i.e., deleting some objects no longer happens quickly if they are complex. How long it takes for Moodle to return control when turning editing back off after deleting an object depends on how large/complex that object is. And Moodle provides no progress indicator that something is happening.    We also saw this behavior when testing the recycle bin plugin our Moodle 2.7 site (we also saw session lock errors for large object deletions). We also see this issue on a test Moodle 3.1 server with the recycle bin enabled. While this quiz example may represent an outlier, users delete all sort of things... small and large objects.",5

However, upon saving, the audio tag is automatically removed so the file is not embedded.  Using the same code in a page resource, the audio tag is not removed.     *STEPS TO REPLICATE*      	1. Create a forum activity.  	2. Add a new post to the forum.  	3. Click the Media button on the text editor.  	4. Upload a .wav file and then click the insert media button.  The .wav file is added to the page as a hyperlink.  	5. Click the HTML button on the text editor to switch into source mode.  	6.

The audio tag has been removed.  The resulting HTML:  {noformat}  <p>The wav file should be embedded.</p>Your browser does not support the audio element.  {noformat}     EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:   The audio tag is retained in the HTML.  The .wav file is embedded into the forum post allowing the audio file to be played directly from the post.     *REPLICATION LOCATIONS*   Behavior has been replicated in 3.0.4 and 2.9.3.    *ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION NOTES*   	1. The audio tag is removed from the forum post HTML regardless of the file type being embedded.  For example, attempting to embed an .mp3 file with the audio tag also results in the audio tag being removed.  	2. Behavior was replicated with both the Atto and TinyMCE text editors.     *USER IMPACT*   An instructor teaching a sound design course would like for students to be able to share their .wav files within forums.  The .wav file format is not among the file formats currently handled by Moodle's media embedding features (see MDL-54846).  A potential work-around would be manually entered the necessary HTML to embed the file, but this cannot be done when the audio tag is automatically removed.",3
