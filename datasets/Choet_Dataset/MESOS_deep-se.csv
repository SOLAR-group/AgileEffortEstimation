MESOS-313,"Report executor terminations to framework schedulers.","The Scheduler interface has a callback for executorLost, but currently it is never called.",2
MESOS-336,"Mesos slave should cache executors","The slave should be smarter about how it handles pulling down executors.  In our environment, executors rarely change but the slave will always pull it down from regardless HDFS.  This puts undue stress on our HDFS clusters, and is not resilient to reduced HDFS availability.",5
MESOS-343,"Expose TASK_FAILED reason to Frameworks.","We now have a message string inside TaskStatus that provides human readable information about TASK_FAILED.    It would be good to add some structure to the failure reasons, for framework schedulers to act on programmatically.

MESOS-708,"Static files missing ""Last-Modified"" HTTP headers","Static assets served by the Mesos master don't return ""Last-Modified"" HTTP headers. That means clients receive a 200 status code and re-download assets on every page request even if the assets haven't changed. Because Angular JS does most of the work, the downloading happens only when you navigate to Mesos master in your browser or use the browser's refresh.    Example header for ""mesos.css"":        HTTP/1.1 200 OK      Date: Thu, 26 Sep 2013 17:18:52 GMT      Content-Length: 1670      Content-Type: text/css    Clients sometimes use the ""Date"" header for the same effect as ""Last-Modified"", but the date is always the time of the response from the server, i.e. it changes on every request and makes the assets look new every time.    The ""Last-Modified"" header should be added and should be the last modified time of the file. On subsequent requests for the same files, the master should return 304 responses with no content rather than 200 with the full files. It could save clients a lot of download time since Mesos assets are rather heavyweight.",2

This can have a big impact on the performance of schedulers (for example, writing task updates that need to be persisted).    (2) The implementation requires writing a lot of boilerplate JNI and native Python wrappers when adding additional API components.    The plan is to provide a lower-level API that can easily be used to implement the higher-level API that is currently provided. This will also open the door to more easily building native-language Mesos libraries (i.e., not needing the C++ shim layer) and building new higher-level abstractions on top of the lower-level API.",8

MESOS-1199,"Subprocess is ""slow"" -> gated by process::reap poll interval","Subprocess uses process::reap to wait on the subprocess pid and set the exit status. However, process::reap polls with a one second interval resulting in a delay up to the interval duration before the status future is set.    This means if you need to wait for the subprocess to complete you get hit with E(delay) = 0.5 seconds, independent of the execution time. For example, the MesosContainerizer uses mesos-fetcher in a Subprocess to fetch the executor during launch. At Twitter we fetch a local file, i.e., a very fast operation, but the launch is blocked until the mesos-fetcher pid is reaped -> adding 0 to 1 seconds for every launch!    The problem is even worse with a chain of short Subprocesses because after the first Subprocess completes you'll be synchronized with the reap interval and you'll see nearly the full interval before notification, i.e., 10 Subprocesses each of << 1 second duration with take ~10 seconds!    This has become particularly apparent in some new tests I'm working on where test durations are now greatly extended with each taking several seconds.",1

MESOS-1529,"Handle a network partition between Master and Slave","If a network partition occurs between a Master and Slave, the Master will remove the Slave (as it fails health check) and mark the tasks being run there as LOST. However, the Slave is not aware that it has been removed so the tasks will continue to run.    (To clarify a little bit: neither the master nor the slave receives 'exited' event, indicating that the connection between the master and slave is not closed).    There are at least two possible approaches to solving this issue:    1. Introduce a health check from Slave to Master so they have a consistent view of a network partition. We may still see this issue should a one-way connection error occur.    2. Be less aggressive about marking tasks and Slaves as lost. Wait until the Slave reappears and reconcile then. We'd still need to mark Slaves and tasks as potentially lost (zombie state) but maybe the Scheduler can make a more intelligent decision.",5

However, most of the time, it's very hard to reproduce the deadlock on dev machines.    I would be cool if we can dump the stack traces of all threads when jenkins build times out.

Operators can set a time limit on how long to wait for schedulers to relocate tasks before the tasks are forcibly terminated.    Inverse resource offers have many other potential uses, as it opens the opportunity for the allocator to attempt to move tasks in the cluster through the co-operation of the framework, possibly providing better over-subscription, fairness, etc.",5

We were originally thinking of using a failover timeout in the master to remove these slaves that don't re-register. However, it can be dangerous when ZooKeeper issues are preventing the slave from re-registering with the master; we do not want to remove a ton of slaves in this situation.    Rather, when the slave is health checking correctly but does not re-register within a timeout, we could send a registration request from the master to the slave, telling the slave that it must re-register. This message could also be used when receiving status updates (or other messages) from slaves that are disconnected in the master.",2
MESOS-1671,"Expose executor metrics for slave.","Expose the following metrics:    slave/executors_registering  slave/executors_running  slave/executors_terminating  slave/executors_terminated",2
MESOS-1672,"Add filter to allocator resourcesRecovered method","The allocator already allows filters to be added when resources are unused. It is useful to also allow the same behaviour in {{resourcesRecovered}}.",2
MESOS-1673,"The value of MASTER_PING_TIMEOUT is non-deterministic","Right now, it is declared as follows:  {noformat}  const Duration MASTER_PING_TIMEOUT =    master::SLAVE_PING_TIMEOUT * master::MAX_SLAVE_PING_TIMEOUTS  {noformat}    Since static initialization order in C++ is undefined, MASTER_PING_TIMEOUT's value is non-deterministic. We've already observed that in tests (where MASTER_PING_TIMEOUT == 0).",1
MESOS-1674,"Kill private_resources and treat 'ephemeral_ports' as a resource.","As the first step to solve MESOS-1654, we need to kill private_resources in SlaveInfo and add a 'ephemeral_ports' resource.    For now, the slave and the port mapping isolator will simply ignore the 'ephemeral_ports' resource in ExecutorInfo and TaskInfo, and make allocation by itself. We will revisit this once the overcommit race (MESOS-1466) is fixed.",3

MESOS-1696,"Improve reconciliation between master and slave.","As we update the Master to keep tasks in memory until they are both terminal and acknowledged (MESOS-1410), the lifetime of tasks in Mesos will look as follows:    {code}  Master           Slave   {}               {}  {Tn}              {}  // Master receives Task T, non-terminal. Forwards to slave.  {Tn}             {Tn} // Slave receives Task T, non-terminal.  {Tn}             {Tt} // Task becomes terminal on slave. Update forwarded.  {Tt}             {Tt} // Master receives update, forwards to framework.   {}              {Tt} // Master receives ack, forwards to slave.   {}               {}  // Slave receives ack.  {code}    In the current form of reconciliation, the slave sends to the master all tasks that are not both terminal and acknowledged. At any point in the above lifecycle, the slave's re-registration message can reach the master.    Note the following properties:    *(1)* The master may have a non-terminal task, not present in the slave's re-registration message.  *(2)* The master may have a non-terminal task, present in the slave's re-registration message but in a different state.  *(3)* The slave's re-registration message may contain a terminal unacknowledged task unknown to the master.    In the current master / slave [reconciliation|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.19.1/src/master/master.cpp#L3146] code, the master assumes that case (1) is because a launch task message was dropped, and it sends TASK_LOST. We've seen above that (1) can happen even when the task reaches the slave correctly, so this can lead to inconsistency!    After chatting with [~vinodkone], we're considering updating the reconciliation to occur as follows:      → Slave sends all tasks that are not both terminal and acknowledged, during re-registration. This is the same as before.    → If the master sees tasks that are missing in the slave, the master sends the tasks that need to be reconciled to the slave for the tasks. This can be piggy-backed on the re-registration message.    → The slave will send TASK_LOST if the task is not known to it. Preferably in a retried manner, unless we update socket closure on the slave to force a re-registration.",3

MESOS-1784,"Design the semantics for updating FrameworkInfo","Currently, there is no easy way for frameworks to update their FrameworkInfo., resulting in issues like MESOS-703 and MESOS-1218.    This ticket captures the design for doing FrameworkInfo update without having to roll masters/slaves/tasks/executors.",3
MESOS-1790,"Add ""chown"" option to CommandInfo.URI","Mesos fetcher always chown()s the extracted executor URIs as the executor user but sometimes this is not desirable, e.g., ""setuid"" bit gets lost during chown() if slave/fetcher is running as root.     It would be nice to give frameworks the ability to skip the chown.",2
MESOS-1799,"Reconciliation can send out-of-order updates.","When a slave re-registers with the master, it currently sends the latest task state for all tasks that are not both terminal and acknowledged.    However, reconciliation assumes that we always have the latest unacknowledged state of the task represented in the master.    As a result, out-of-order updates are possible, e.g.    (1) Slave has task T in TASK_FINISHED, with unacknowledged updates: [TASK_RUNNING, TASK_FINISHED].  (2) Master fails over.  (3) New master re-registers the slave with T in TASK_FINISHED.  (4) Reconciliation request arrives, master sends TASK_FINISHED.  (5) Slave sends TASK_RUNNING to master, master sends TASK_RUNNING.    I think the fix here is to preserve the task state invariants in the master, namely, that the master has the latest unacknowledged state of the task. This means when the slave re-registers, it should instead send the latest acknowledged state of each task.",3
MESOS-1807,"Disallow executors with cpu only or memory only resources","Currently master allows executors to be launched with either only cpus or only memory but we shouldn't allow that.  This is because executor is an actual unix process that is launched by the slave. If an executor doesn't specify cpus, what should do the cpu limits be for that executor when there are no tasks running on it? If no cpu limits are set then it might starve other executors/tasks on the slave violating isolation guarantees. Same goes with memory. Moreover, the current containerizer/isolator code will throw failures when using such an executor, e.g., when the last task on the executor finishes and Containerizer::update() is called with 0 cpus or 0 mem.",3
MESOS-1808,"Expose RTT in container stats","As we expose the bandwidth, so we should expose the RTT as a measure of latency each container is experiencing.    We can use {{ss}} to get the per-socket statistics and filter and aggregate accordingly to get a measure of RTT.",3
MESOS-1811,"Reconcile disconnected/deactivated semantics in the master code","Currently the master code treats a deactivated and disconnected slave similarly, by setting 'disconnected' variable in the slave struct. This causes us to disconnect() a slave in cases where we really only want to deactivate() the slave (e.g., authentication).    It would be nice to differentiate these semantics by adding a new variable ""active"" in the Slave struct.    We might want to do the same with the Framework struct for consistency.",3
MESOS-1813,"Fail fast in example frameworks if task goes into unexpected state","Most of the example frameworks launch a bunch of tasks and exit if *all* of them reach FINISHED state. But if there is a bug in the code resulting in TASK_LOST, the framework waits forever. Instead the framework should abort if an un-expected task state is encountered.",1

MESOS-1815,"Create a guide to becoming a committer","We have a committer's guide, but the process by which one becomes a committer is unclear. We should set some guidelines and a process by which we can grow contributors into committers.",3
MESOS-1817,"Completed tasks remains in TASK_RUNNING when framework is disconnected","We have run into a problem that cause tasks which completes, when a framework is disconnected and has a fail-over time, to remain in a running state even though the tasks actually finishes. This hogs the cluster and gives users a inconsistent view of the cluster state. Going to the slave, the task is finished. Going to the master, the task is still in a non-terminal state. When the scheduler reattaches or the failover timeout expires, the tasks finishes correctly. The current workflow of this scheduler has a long fail-over timeout, but may on the other hand never reattach.    Here is a test framework we have been able to reproduce the issue with: https://gist.github.com/nqn/9b9b1de9123a6e836f54  It launches many short-lived tasks (1 second sleep) and when killing the framework instance, the master reports the tasks as running even after several minutes: http://cl.ly/image/2R3719461e0t/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-10%20at%203.19.39%20PM.png    When clicking on one of the slaves where, for example, task 49 runs; the slave knows that it completed: http://cl.ly/image/2P410L3m1O1N/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-10%20at%203.21.29%20PM.png    Here is the log of a mesos-local instance where I reproduced it: https://gist.github.com/nqn/f7ee20601199d70787c0 (Here task 10 to 19 are stuck in running state).  There is a lot of output, so here is a filtered log for task 10: https://gist.github.com/nqn/a53e5ea05c5e41cd5a7d    The problem turn out to be an issue with the ack-cycle of status updates:  If the framework disconnects (with a failover timeout set), the status update manage on the slaves will keep trying to send the front of status update stream to the master (which in turn forwards it to the framework). If the first status update after the disconnect is terminal, things work out fine; the master pick the terminal state up, removes the task and release the resources.  If, on the other hand, one non-terminal status is in the stream. The master will never know that the task finished (or failed) before the framework reconnects.    During a discussion on the dev mailing list (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/mesos-dev/201409.mbox/%3cCADKthhAVR5mrq1s9HXw1BB_XFALXWWxjutp7MV4y3wP-Bh=aWg@mail.gmail.com%3e) we enumerated a couple of options to solve this problem.    First off, having two ack-cycles: one between masters and slaves and one between masters and frameworks, would be ideal. We would be able to replay the statuses in order while keeping the master state current. However, this requires us to persist the master state in a replicated storage.    As a first pass, we can make sure that the tasks caught in a running state doesn't hog the cluster when completed and the framework being disconnected.    Here is a proof-of-concept to work out of: https://github.com/nqn/mesos/tree/niklas/status-update-disconnect/    A new (optional) field have been added to the internal status update message:  https://github.com/nqn/mesos/blob/niklas/status-update-disconnect/src/messages/messages.proto#L68    Which makes it possible for the status update manager to set the field, if the latest status was terminal: https://github.com/nqn/mesos/blob/niklas/status-update-disconnect/src/slave/status_update_manager.cpp#L501    I added a test which should high-light the issue as well:  https://github.com/nqn/mesos/blob/niklas/status-update-disconnect/src/tests/fault_tolerance_tests.cpp#L2478    I would love some input on the approach before moving on.  There are rough edges in the PoC which (of course) should be addressed before bringing it for up review.",2
MESOS-1830,"Expose master stats differentiating between master-generated and slave-generated LOST tasks","The master exports a monotonically-increasing counter of tasks transitioned to TASK_LOST.  This loses fidelity of the source of the lost task.  A first step in exposing the source of lost tasks might be to just differentiate between TASK_LOST transitions initiated by the master vs the slave (and maybe bad input from the scheduler).",5

MESOS-1866,"Race between ~Authenticator() and Authenticator::authenticate() can lead to schedulers/slaves to never get authenticated","The master might get a duplicate authenticate() request while a previous authentication attempt is in progress. Depending on what the AuthenticatorProcess is executing at the time, there are 2 possible race conditions which will cause scheduler/slave to continuously retry authentication but never succeed.    We have seen both the race conditions in a heavily loaded production cluster.    Race1:  ----------  --> An authenticate() event was dispatched to AuthenticatorProcess (Master::authenticate() called Authenticator::authenticate())    --> A terminate() event was then injected into the front of the AuthenticatorProcess queue (duplicate Master::authenticate() did ~Authenticator) before the above authenticate() event was executed.    --> Due to the bug in libprocess, the future returned by Master::authenticate() was never transitioned to discarded (Master::_authenticate() was never called).    --> This caused all the subsequent authentication retries to be enqueued on the master waiting for Master::_authenticate() to be executed.    Fix: Transition the dispatched future to discarded if the libprocess is terminated (https://reviews.apache.org/r/25945/)    Race 2:  -----------  --> An authenticate() event was dispatched to AuthenticatorProcess (Master::authenticate() called Authenticator::authenticate())    --> AuthenticatorProcess::authenticate() executed and set promise.onDiscard(defer(self, Self::discarded)). NOTE: The internal promise of AuthenticatorProcess is discarded in AuthenticatorProcess::discarded()    --> A terminate() event was then injected into the front of the AuthenticatorProcess queue (duplicate Master::authenticate() did   ~Authenticator) before the above discarded() event was executed)    --> ~AuthenticatorProcess is destructed without ever discarding the internal promise (Master::_authenticate() was never called).    --> This caused all the subsequent authentication retries to be enqueued on the master waiting for Master::_authenticate() to be executed.    Fix: The fix here is to discard the internal promise when the AuthenticatorProcess is destructed.",2

With such a source code-independent specification, we could write unbiased regression and scale tests, which would be instrumental in maintaining high quality.    Furthermore, this would make the source code more amenable.    Why pick this particular area of the source code? Shouldn't more of Mesos have a thorough specification? Probably so.

MESOS-1974,"Refactor the C++ Resources abstraction for DiskInfo","As we introduce DiskInfo and reservation for Resource. We need to change the C++ Resources abstraction to properly deal with merge/split of resources with those additional fields.    Also, the existing C++ 'Resources' interfaces are poorly designed. Some of them are confusing and unintuitive. Some of them are overloaded with too many functionalities. For instance,    {noformat}  bool operator <= (const Resource& left, const Resource& right);  {noformat}    This interface in non-intuitive because A <= B doesn't imply !(B <= A).    {noformat}  Resource operator + (const Resource& left, const Resource& right);  {noformat}    This one is also non-intuitive because if 'left' is not compatible with 'right', the result is 'left' (why not right???). Similar for operator '-'.    {noformat}  Option<Resource> Resources::get(const Resource& r) const;  {noformat}    This one assume Resources is flattened, but it might not be.    As we start to introduce persistent disk resources (MESOS-1554), things will get more complicated. For example, one may want to get two types of 'disk()' functions: one returns the ephemeral disk bytes (with no disk info), one returns the total disk bytes (including ones that have disk info). We may wanna introduce a concept about Resource that indicates that a resource cannot be merged or split (e.g., atomic?).    Since we need to change this class anyway. I wanna take this chance to refactor it.",8

MESOS-2032,"Update Maintenance design to account for persistent resources.","With persistent resources and dynamic reservations, frameworks need to know how long the resources will be unavailable for maintenance operations.    This is because for persistent resources, the framework needs to understand how long the persistent resource will be unavailable. For example, if there will be a 10 minute reboot for a kernel upgrade, the framework will not want to re-replicate all of it's persistent data on the machine. Rather, tolerating one unavailable replica for the maintenance window would be preferred.    I'd like to do a revisit of the design to ensure it works well for persistent resources as well.",13

Specifically, it does not recover the 'completed' flag.    However, if the slave has removed the executor (because launch failed or the executor failed to register) the sentinel flag will be set and this fact should be recovered. This ensures that container recovery is not attempted later.    This was discovered when the LinuxLauncher failed to recover because it was asked to recover two containers with the same forkedPid. Investigation showed the executors both OOM'ed before registering, i.e., no libprocess pid file was present. However, the containerizer had detected the OOM, destroyed the container, and notified the slave which cleaned everything up: failing the task and calling removeExecutor (which writes the completed sentinel file.)",1

This even holds if multiple tasks request the same URI concurrently. If multiple requests for the same URI occur, perform only one of them and reuse the result. Make concurrent requests for the same URI wait for the one download.     Different URIs from different CommandInfos can be downloaded concurrently.    No cache eviction, cleanup or failover will be handled for now. Additional tickets will be filed for these enhancements. (So don't use this feature in production until the whole epic is complete.)    Note that implementing this does not suffice for production use. This ticket contains the main part of the fetcher logic, though. See the epic MESOS-336 for the rest of the features that lead to a fully functional fetcher cache.    The proposed general approach is to keep all bookkeeping about what is in which stage of being fetched and where it resides in the slave's MesosContainerizerProcess, so that all concurrent access is disambiguated and controlled by an ""actor"" (aka libprocess ""process"").

MESOS-2072,"Fetcher cache eviction","Delete files from the fetcher cache so that a given cache size is never exceeded. Succeed in doing so while concurrent downloads are on their way and new requests are pouring in.    Idea: measure the size of each download before it begins, make enough room before the download. This means that only download mechanisms that divulge the size before the main download will be supported. AFAWK, those in use so far have this property.     The calculation of how much space to free needs to be under concurrency control, accumulating all space needed for competing, incomplete download requests. (The Python script that performs fetcher caching for Aurora does not seem to implement this. See https://gist.github.com/zmanji/f41df77510ef9d00265a, imagine several of these programs running concurrently, each one's _cache_eviction() call succeeding, each perceiving the SAME free space being available.)    Ultimately, a conflict resolution strategy is needed if just the downloads underway already exceed the cache capacity. Then, as a fallback, direct download into the work directory will be used for some tasks. TBD how to pick which task gets treated how.     At first, only support copying of any downloaded files to the work directory for task execution. This isolates the task life cycle after starting a task from cache eviction considerations.     (Later, we can add symbolic links that avoid copying. But then eviction of fetched files used by ongoing tasks must be blocked, which adds complexity. another future extension is MESOS-1667 ""Extract from URI while downloading into work dir"").  ",8
MESOS-2074,"Fetcher cache test fixture","To accelerate providing good test coverage for the fetcher cache (MESOS-336), we can provide a framework that canonicalizes creating and running a number of tasks and allows easy parametrization with combinations of the following:  - whether to cache or not  - whether make what has been downloaded executable or not  - whether to extract from an archive or not  - whether to download from a file system, http, or...    We can create a simple HHTP server in the test fixture to support the latter.    Furthermore, the tests need to be robust wrt. varying numbers of StatusUpdate messages. An accumulating update message sink that reports the final state is needed.    All this has already been programmed in this patch, just needs to be rebased:  https://reviews.apache.org/r/21316/",5
MESOS-2075,"Add maintenance information to the replicated registry.","To achieve fault-tolerance for the maintenance primitives, we will need to add the maintenance information to the registry.    The registry currently stores all of the slave information, which is quite large (~ 17MB for 50,000 slaves from my testing), which results in a protobuf object that is extremely expensive to copy.    As far as I can tell, reads / writes to maintenance information is independent of reads / writes to the existing 'registry' information. So there are two approach here:    h4. Add maintenance information to 'maintenance' key:   # The advantage of this approach is that we don't further grow the large Registry object.  # This approach assumes that writes to 'maintenance' are independent of writes to the 'registry'. -If these writes are not independent, this approach requires that we add transactional support to the State abstraction.-  # -This approach requires adding compaction to LogStorage.-  # This approach likely requires some refactoring to the Registrar.    h4. Add maintenance information to 'registry' key: (This is the chosen method.)  # The advantage of this approach is that it's the easiest to implement.  # This will further grow the single 'registry' object, but doesn't preclude it being split apart in the future.  # This approach may require using the diff support in LogStorage and/or adding compression support to LogStorage snapshots to deal with the increased size of the registry.",13

On the other side, after a similar timeout, the slave will consider the master lost and try to detect a new master. These timeouts are currently hardcoded constants (5 * 15s), which may not be well-suited for all scenarios.  - Some clusters may tolerate a longer slave process restart period, and wouldn't want tasks to be killed upon reconnect.  - Some clusters may have higher-latency networks (e.g. cross-datacenter, or for volunteer computing efforts), and would like to tolerate longer periods without communication.    We should provide flags/mechanisms on the master to control its tolerance for non-communicative slaves, and (less importantly?) on the slave to tolerate missing masters.",8

MESOS-2176,"Hierarchical allocator inconsistently accounts for reserved resources. ","Looking through the allocator code for MESOS-2099, I see an issue with respect to accounting reserved resources in the sorters:    Within {{HierarchicalAllocatorProcess::allocate}}, only unreserved resources are accounted for in the sorters, whereas everywhere else (add/remove framework, add/remove slave) we account for both reserved and unreserved.    From git blame, it looks like this issue was introduced over a long course of refactoring and fixes to the allocator. My guess is that this was never caught due to the lack of unit-testability of the allocator (unnecessarily requires a master PID to use an allocator).    From my understanding, the two levels of the hierarchical sorter should have the following semantics:    # Level 1 sorts across roles. Only unreserved resources are shared across roles, and therefore the ""role sorter"" for level 1 should only account for the unreserved resource pool.  # Level 2 sorts across frameworks, within a role. Both unreserved and reserved resources are shared across frameworks within a role, and therefore the ""framework sorters"" for level 2 should each account for the reserved resource pool for the role, as well as the unreserved resources _allocated_ inside the role.",5
MESOS-2182,"Performance issue in libprocess SocketManager.","Noticed an issue in production under which the master is slow to respond after failover for ~15 minutes.    After looking at some perf data, the top offender is:    {noformat}      12.02%  mesos-master  libmesos-0.21.0-rc3.so  [.] std::_Rb_tree<process::ProcessBase*, process::ProcessBase*, std::_Identity<process::ProcessBase*>, std::less<process::ProcessBase*>, std::allocator<process::ProcessBase*> >::erase(process::ProcessBase* const&)  ...       3.29%  mesos-master  libmesos-0.21.0-rc3.so  [.] process::SocketManager::exited(process::ProcessBase*)  {noformat}    It appears that in the SocketManager, whenever an internal Process exits, we loop over all the links unnecessarily:    {code}  void SocketManager::exited(ProcessBase* process)  {    // An exited event is enough to cause the process to get deleted    // (e.g., by the garbage collector), which means we can't    // dereference process (or even use the address) after we enqueue at    // least one exited event. Thus, we save the process pid.    const UPID pid = process->pid;      // Likewise, we need to save the current time of the process so we    // can update the clocks of linked processes as appropriate.    const Time time = Clock::now(process);      synchronized (this) {      // Iterate through the links, removing any links the process might      // have had and creating exited events for any linked processes.      foreachpair (const UPID& linkee, set<ProcessBase*>& processes, links) {        processes.erase(process);          if (linkee == pid) {          foreach (ProcessBase* linker, processes) {            CHECK(linker != process) << ""Process linked with itself"";            synchronized (timeouts) {              if (Clock::paused()) {                Clock::update(linker, time);              }            }            linker->enqueue(new ExitedEvent(linkee));          }        }      }        links.erase(pid);    }  }  {code}    On clusters with 10,000s of slaves, this means we hold the socket manager lock for a very expensive loop erasing nothing from a set! This is because, the master contains links from the Master Process to each slave. However, when a random ephemeral Process terminates, we don't need to loop over each slave link.    While we hold this lock, the following calls will block:    {code}  class SocketManager  {  public:    Socket accepted(int s);    void link(ProcessBase* process, const UPID& to);    PID<HttpProxy> proxy(const Socket& socket);    void send(Encoder* encoder, bool persist);    void send(const Response& response,              const Request& request,              const Socket& socket);    void send(Message* message);    Encoder* next(int s);    void close(int s);    void exited(const Node& node);    void exited(ProcessBase* process);  ...  {code}    As a result, the slave observers and the master can block calling send()!    Short term, we will try to fix this issue by removing the unnecessary looping. Longer term, it would be nice to avoid all this locking when sending on independent sockets.",3

MESOS-2257,"Version the Operator/Admin API","As a consumer of the Mesos HTTP API, it is necessary for us to determine the current version of Mesos so that we can parse the JSON documents returned correctly (since they change from version to version).     Currently we're doing this by fetching state.json, parsing it and pulling out the version field. A more idiomatic way to do this would be to filter on the content-type in the header itself.    To give a more concrete example, currently the JSON documents returned by the HTTP API return the following headers:  {code}  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Date: Fri, 23 Jan 2015 21:31:37 GMT  Content-Length: 9352  Content-Type: application/json  {code}    Something like the following (e.g. for master/state.json) would be easy to switch upon:  {code}  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Date: Fri, 23 Jan 2015 21:31:37 GMT  Content-Length: 9352  Content-Type: application/vnd.mesos.master.state.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  {code}    The vnd prefix is typically used for vendor specific file types (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type#Prefix_vnd). Charset=utf-8 is required for JSON documents and is currently being omitted.    This content-type would change for each document type, for example:  {code}  application/vnd.mesos.master.state.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  application/vnd.mesos.master.stats.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  application/vnd.mesos.slave.state.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  application/vnd.mesos.slave.stats.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  {code}    Alternatively, the version could be appended as an extra field:  {code}  application/vnd.mesos.master.state+json; charset=utf-8; version=v0.20.1  application/vnd.mesos.master.stats+json; charset=utf-8; version=v0.20.1  application/vnd.mesos.slave.state+json; charset=utf-8; version=v0.20.1  application/vnd.mesos.slave.stats+json; charset=utf-8; version=v0.20.1  {code}    Thanks!",13

MESOS-2305,"Refactor validators in Master.","There are several motivation for this. We are in the process of adding dynamic reservations and persistent volumes support in master. To do that, master needs to validate relevant operations from the framework (See Offer::Operation in mesos.proto). The existing validator style in master is hard to extend, compose and re-use.

For example if we have an ExecutorInfo with a CommandInfo with the {{shell}} attribute unset and then we change the CommandInfo to set the {{shell}} attribute to true Mesos will reject the task with:    {noformat}  I0130 21:50:05.373389 50869 master.cpp:3441] Sending status update TASK_LOST (UUID: 82ef615c-0d59-4427-95d5-80cf0e52b3fc) for task system-gc-c89c0c05-200c-462e-958a-ecd7b9a76831 of framework 201103282247-0000000019-0000 'Task has invalid ExecutorInfo (existing ExecutorInfo with same ExecutorID is not compatible).  {noformat}    This is not intuitive because the default value of the {{shell}} attribute is true.

MESOS-2314,"remove unnecessary constants","In {{src/slave/paths.cpp}} a number of string constants are defined to describe the formats of various paths. However, given there is a 1:1 mapping between the string constant and the functions that build the paths, the code would be more readable if the format strings were inline in the functions.    In the cases where one constant depends on another (see the {{EXECUTOR_INFO_PATH, EXECUTOR_PATH, FRAMEWORK_PATH, SLAVE_PATH, ROOT_PATH}} chain, for example) the function calls can just be chained together.    This will have the added benefit of removing some statically constructed string constants, which are dangerous.",2

MESOS-2335,"Mesos Lifecycle Modules","A new kind of module that receives callbacks at significant life cycle events of its host libprocess process. Typically the latter is a Mesos slave or master and the life time of the libprocess process coincides with the underlying OS process.     h4. Motivation and Use Cases    We want to add customized and experimental capabilities that concern the life time of Mesos components without protruding into Mesos source code and without creating new build process dependencies for everybody.     Example use cases:  1. A slave or master life cycle module that gathers fail-over incidents and reports summaries thereof to a remote data sink.  2. A slave module that observes host computer metrics and correlates these with task activity. This can be used to find resources leaks and to prevent, respectively guide, oversubscription.  3. Upgrades and provisioning that require shutdown and restart.    h4. Specifics    The specific life cycle events that we want to get notified about and want to be able to act upon are:    - Process is spawning/initializing  - Process is terminating/finalizing    In all these cases, a reference to the process is passed as a parameter, giving the module access for inspection and reaction.     h4. Module Classification    Unlike other named modules, a life cycle module does not directly replace or provide essential Mesos functionality (such as an Isolator module does). Unlike a decorator module it does not directly add or inject data into Mesos core either.",1

MESOS-2340,"Add ability to decode JSON serialized MasterInfo from ZK","Currently to discover the master a client needs the ZK node location and access to the MasterInfo protobuf so it can deserialize the binary blob in the node.    I think it would be nice to publish JSON (like Twitter's ServerSets) so clients are not tied to protobuf to do service discovery.    This ticket is an intermediate (compatibility) step: we add in {{0.23}} the ability for the {{Detector}} to ""understand"" JSON **alongside** Protobuf serialized format; this makes it compatible with both earlier versions, as well a future one (most likely, {{0.24}}) that will write the {{MasterInfo}} information in JSON format.",5
MESOS-2347,"Add ability for schedulers to explicitly acknowledge status updates on the driver.","In order for schedulers to be able to handle status updates in a scalable manner, they need the ability to send acknowledgements through the driver. This enables optimizations in schedulers (e.g. process status updates asynchronously w/o backing up the driver, processing/acking updates in batch).    Without this, an implicit reconciliation can overload a scheduler (hence the motivation for MESOS-2308).",8
MESOS-2349,"Provide a way to execute an arbitrary process in a MesosContainerizer container context","Include a separate binary that when provided with a container_id, path to an executable, and optional arguments will find the container context, enter it, and exec the executable.    e.g.,  {noformat}  mesos-container-exec --container_id=abc123 [--] /path/to/executable [arg1 ...]  {noformat}    This need only support (initially) containers created with the MesosContainerizer and will support all isolators shipped with Mesos, i.e., it should find and enter the cgroups and namespaces for the running executor of the specified container.",5
MESOS-2350,"Add support for MesosContainerizerLaunch to chroot to a specified path","In preparation for the MesosContainerizer to support a filesystem isolator the MesosContainerizerLauncher must support chrooting. Optionally, it should also configure the chroot environment by (re-)mounting special filesystems such as /proc and /sys and making device nodes such as /dev/zero, etc., such that the chroot environment is functional.",5
MESOS-2353,"Improve performance of the state.json endpoint for large clusters.","The master's state.json endpoint consistently takes a long time to compute the JSON result, for large clusters:    {noformat}  $ time curl -s -o /dev/null localhost:5050/master/state.json  Mon Jan 26 22:38:50 UTC 2015    real	0m13.174s  user	0m0.003s  sys	0m0.022s  {noformat}    This can cause the master to get backlogged if there are many state.json requests in flight.    Looking at {{perf}} data, it seems most of the time is spent doing memory allocation / de-allocation. This ticket will try to capture any low hanging fruit to speed this up. Possibly we can leverage moves if they are not already being used by the compiler.",5

MESOS-2382,"replace unsafe ""find | xargs"" with ""find -exec""","The problem exists in   1194:src/Makefile.am   47:src/tests/balloon_framework_test.sh    The current ""find | xargs rm -rf"" in the Makefile could potentially destroy data if mesos source was in a folder with a space in the name. E.g. if you for some reason checkout mesos to ""/ mesos"" the command in src/Makefile.am would turn into a rm -rf /    ""find | xargs"" should be NUL delimited with ""find -print0 | xargs -0"" for safer execution or can just be replaced with the find build-in option ""find -exec '{}' \+"" which behaves similar to xargs.

Seems that the additional sleep process is not necessary. The slave can just monitor the duration and send a SIGINT to the perf process when duration elapsed.

MESOS-2595,"Create docker executor","Currently we're reusing the command executor to wait on the progress of the docker executor, but has the following drawback:    - We need to launch a seperate docker log process just to forward logs, where we can just simply reattach stdout/stderr if we create a specific executor for docker  - In general, Mesos slave is assuming that the executor is the one starting the actual task. But the current docker containerizer, the containerizer is actually starting the docker container first then launches the command executor to wait on it. This can cause problems if the container failed before the command executor was able to launch, as slave will try to update the limits of the containerizer on executor registration but then the docker containerizer will fail to do so since the container failed.     Overall it's much simpler to tie the container lifecycle with the executor and simplfies logic and log management.",8

Many of our functions return Futures by value:    {code}    class Socket {      Future<Socket> accept();      Future<size_t> recv(char* data, size_t size);      ...    }    {code}    - Sometimes we capture these Futures:    {code}    {      const Future<Socket>& accepted = socket.accept(); // Valid c++, propose we disallow.    }    {code}    - Sometimes we chain these Futures:    {code}    {      socket.accept().then(lambda::bind(_accepted)); // Temporary will be valid during 'then' expression evaluation.    }    {code}    - Sometimes we do both:    {code}    {      const Future<Socket>& accepted = socket.accept().then(lambda::bind(_accepted)); // Dangerous! 'accepted' lifetime will not be valid till end of scope. Disallow!    }    {code}    h3. Reasoning  - Although (1) is ok, and considered a [feature|http://herbsutter.com/2008/01/01/gotw-88-a-candidate-for-the-most-important-const/], (2) is extremely dangerous and leads to hard to track bugs.  - If we explicitly allow (1), but disallow (2), then my worry is that someone coming along to maintain the code later on may accidentally turn (1) into (2), without recognizing the severity of this mistake. For example:  {code}  // Original code:  const T& val = T();  std::cout << val << std::endl;  // New code:  const T& val = T().removeWhiteSpace();  std::cout << val << std::endl; // val could be corrupted since the destructor has been invoked and T's memory freed.  {code}  - If we disallow both cases: it will be easier to catch these mistakes early on in code reviews (and avoid these painful bugs), at the same cost of introducing a new style guide rule.    h3. Performance Implications  - BenH suggests c++ developers are commonly taught to capture by constant reference to hint to the compiler that the copy can be elided.  - Modern compilers use a Data Flow Graph to make optimizations such as    - *In-place-construction*: leveraged by RVO and NRVO to construct the object in place on the stack. Similar to ""*Placement new*"": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placement_syntax    - *RVO* (Return Value Optimization): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization    - *NRVO* (Named Return Value Optimization): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms364057%28v=vs.80%29.aspx  - Since modern compilers perform these optimizations, we no longer need to 'hint' to the compiler that the copies can be elided.    h3. Example program  {code}  #include <stdio.h>    class T {  public:    T(const char* str) : Str(str) {      printf(""+ T(%s)\n"", Str);    }    ~T() {      printf(""- T(%s)\n"", Str);    }    const T& Member() const    {      return *this;    }  private:    const char* Str;  };    T f(const char* s) { return T(s); }    int main() {    const T& good = T(""Ok"");    const T& good_f = f(""Ok function"");      const T& bad = T(""Bad!"").Member();    const T& bad_f = T(""Bad function!"").Member();      printf(""End of function scope...\n"");  }  {code}  Output:  {code}  + T(Ok)  + T(Ok function)  + T(Bad!)  - T(Bad!)  + T(Bad function!)  - T(Bad function!)  End of function scope...  - T(Ok function)  - T(Ok)  {code}",1

MESOS-2734,"Update allocator to allocate revocable resources","The simplest way to add support for oversubscribed resources to the allocator is to simply add them to the already existing 'Slave.total' and 'Slave.available' variables. It is easy to distinguish the revocable resources by doing a .revocable() filter.       ",5
MESOS-2735,"Change the interaction between the slave and the resource estimator from polling to pushing ","This will make the semantics more clear. The resource estimator can control the speed of sending resources estimation to the slave.    To avoid cyclic dependency, slave will register a callback with the resource estimator and the resource estimator will simply invoke that callback when there's a new estimation ready. The callback will be a defer to the slave's main event queue.",3

Beyond making it harder (and opaque; open to subtle bugs) for languages other than C/C++ to decode into an IPv4 octets, this does not allow Mesos to support IPv6 Master nodes.    We should consider ways to upgrade it in ways that permit us to support both IPv4 / IPv6 nodes, and, possibly, in a way that makes it easy for languages such as Java/Python that already have PB support, so could easily deserialize this information.    See also MESOS-2709 for more info.",3

This Story is about first looking at the workflow; ensuring the stories and their status(es) are consistent; that button in the UI are consistently applied and then correct any issues that may have been identified.    The assumption here is that the workflow is:  {noformat}  Open >> Accepted >> Progress >> Reviewable >> Resolved >> Closed     Accept       Start      Ready         Resolve      Close  {noformat}  and, at each stage, it can be moved ""back by one"" ({{Unaccept}}, {{Stop Progress}}, {{Unresolve}}) and that, at any stage, it can be moved to {{Closed}} (for whatever reason).",2

MESOS-2808,"Slave should call into resource estimator whenever it wants to forward oversubscribed resources","Currently, the polling of resource estimator is decoupled from the loop in the slave that forwards oversubscribed resources.    Now that the slave only sends updates when there is a change from the previous estimate, it can just poll the resource estimator whenever it wants to send an estimate. One advantage with this is that if the estimator is slow to respond, the slave doesn't keep forwarding estimates with the stale 'oversubscribable' value causing more revocable tasks to be unintentionally launched.",3
MESOS-2814,"os::read should have one implementation","In master there are currently three implementations of the function:   https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/3rdparty/libprocess/3rdparty/stout/include/stout/os/read.hpp#L42  https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/3rdparty/libprocess/3rdparty/stout/include/stout/os/read.hpp#L82  https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/3rdparty/libprocess/3rdparty/stout/include/stout/os/read.hpp#L42    All of them have fairly radically different implementations (One uses C read(), one uses c++ ifstream, one uses c fopen)    The read() based one does an excess / unnecessary copy / buffer allocation (it is going to read into one temporary buffer, then copy into the result string. Would be more efficient to do a .reserve() on the result string, and then fill the result buffer).    The ifstream/ifstreambuf_iterator ignores that you can have an error partially through reading a file / doesn't find the error or propagate it up.    The fopen() variant reads one newline separated line at a time. This could produce interesting / unexpected reading in the context of a binary file. It also causes glibc to insert null bytes at the end of the buffer it reads (excess computation). result isn't pre-allocated to be the right length, meaning that most of the continually read lines will result in realloc() and a lot of memory copies which will be inefficient on large files.",3

MESOS-2817,"Support revocable/non-revocable CPU updates in Mesos containerizer","MESOS-2652 provided preliminary support for revocable cpu resources only when specified in the initial resources for a container.

Higher level logic is responsible for adding/removing based on some policy.",3
MESOS-2818,"Pass 'allocated' resources for each executor to the resource estimator.","Resource estimator obviously need this information to calculate, say the usage slack. Now the question is how. There are two approaches:    1) Pass in the allocated resources for each executor through the 'oversubscribable()' interface.    2) Let containerizer return total resources allocated for each container when 'usages()' are invoked.    I would suggest to take route (1) for several reasons:    1) Eventually, we'll need to pass in slave's total resources to the resource estimator (so that RE can calculate allocation slack). There is no way that we can get that from containerizer. The slave's total resources keep changing due to dynamic reservation. So we cannot pass in the slave total resources during initialization.    2) The current implementation of usages() might skip some containers if it fails to get statistics for that container (not an error). This will cause in-complete information to the RE.    3) We may want to calculate 'unallocated = total - allocated' so that we can send allocation slack as well. Getting 'total' and 'allocated' from two different components might result in inconsistent value. Remember that 'total' keeps changing due to dynamic reservation.",3

MESOS-2832,"Enable configuring Mesos with environment variables without having them leak to tasks launched","Currently if mesos is configured with environment variables (MESOS_MODULES), those show up in every task which is launched unless the executor explicitly cleans them up.

However, it should be possible for processes running in the cluster to discover capabilities or features of frameworks in order to achieve a higher level of functionality and a more seamless integration experience across the cluster.    A rich discovery API attached to the FrameworkInfo could result in some form of early lock-in: there are probably many ways to realize cross-framework integration and external services integration that we haven't considered yet. Rather than over-specify a discovery info message type at the framework level I think FrameworkInfo should expose a **very generic** way to supply metadata for interested consumers (other processes, tasks, etc).    Adding a Labels field to FrameworkInfo reuses an existing message type and seems to fit well with the overall intent: attaching generic metadata to a framework instance. These labels should be visible when querying a mesos master's state.json endpoint.",8

MESOS-2883,"Do not call hook manager if no hooks installed","Hooks modules allow us to provide decorators during various aspects of a task lifecycle such as label decorator, environment decorator, etc.  Often the call into such a decorator hooks results in a new copy of labels, environment, etc., being returned to the call site. This is an unnecessary overhead if there are no hooks installed.    The proper way would be to call decorators via the hook manager only if there are some hooks installed. This would prevent unnecessary copying overhead if no hooks are available.",2
MESOS-2884,"Allow isolators to specify required namespaces","Currently, the LinuxLauncher looks into SlaveFlags to compute the namespaces that should be enabled when launching the executor. This means that a custom Isolator module doesn't have any way to specify dependency on a set of namespaces.    The proposed solution is to extend the Isolator interface to also export the namespaces dependency. This way the MesosContainerizer can directly query all loaded Isolators (inbuilt and custom modules) to compute the set of namespaces required by the executor. This set of namespaces is then passed on to the LinuxLauncher.  ",5

MESOS-2890,"Sandbox URL doesn't work in web-ui when using SSL","The links to the sandbox in the web ui don't work when ssl is enabled.   This can happen if the certificate for the master and the slave do not match. This is a consequence of the redirection that happens when serving files.  The resolution to this is currently to set up your certificates to serve the hostnames of the master and slaves.",3
MESOS-2891,"Performance regression in hierarchical allocator.","For large clusters, the 0.23.0 allocator cannot keep up with the volume of slaves. After the following slave was re-registered, it took the allocator a long time to work through the backlog of slaves to add:    {noformat:title=45 minute delay}  I0618 18:55:40.738399 10172 master.cpp:3419] Re-registered slave 20150422-211121-2148346890-5050-3253-S4695  I0618 19:40:14.960636 10164 hierarchical.hpp:496] Added slave 20150422-211121-2148346890-5050-3253-S4695  {noformat}    Empirically, [addSlave|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/dda49e688c7ece603ac7a04a977fc7085c713dd1/src/master/allocator/mesos/hierarchical.hpp#L462] and [updateSlave|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/dda49e688c7ece603ac7a04a977fc7085c713dd1/src/master/allocator/mesos/hierarchical.hpp#L533] have become expensive.    Some timings from a production cluster reveal that the allocator spending in the low tens of milliseconds for each call to {{addSlave}} and {{updateSlave}}, when there are tens of thousands of slaves this amounts to the large delay seen above.    We also saw a slow steady increase in memory consumption, hinting further at a queue backup in the allocator.    A synthetic benchmark like we did for the registrar would be prudent here, along with visibility into the allocator's queue size.",3

MESOS-2902,"Enable Mesos to use arbitrary script / module to figure out IP, HOSTNAME","Currently Mesos tries to guess the IP, HOSTNAME by doing a reverse DNS lookup. This doesn't work on a lot of clouds as we want things like public IPs (which aren't the default DNS), there aren't FQDN names (Azure), or the correct way to figure it out is to call some cloud-specific endpoint.    If Mesos / Libprocess could load a mesos-module (Or run a script) which is provided per-cloud, we can figure out perfectly the IP / Hostname for the given environment. It also means we can ship one identical set of files to all hosts in a given provider which doesn't happen to have the DNS scheme + hostnames that libprocess/Mesos expects. Currently we have to generate host-specific config files which Mesos uses to guess.    The host-specific files break / fall apart if machines change IP / hostname without being reinstalled.",5

MESOS-2919,"Framework can overcommit oversubscribable resources during master failover.","This is due to a bug in the hierarchical allocator. Here is the sequence of events:    1) slave uses a fixed resource estimator which advertise 4 revocable cpus  2) a framework A launches a task that uses all the 4 revocable cpus  3) master fails over  4) slave re-registers with the new master, and sends UpdateSlaveMessage with 4 revocable cpus as oversubscribed resources  5) framework A hasn't registered yet, therefore, the slave's available resources will be 4 revocable cpus  6) framework A registered and will receive an additional 4 revocable cpus. So it can launch another task with 4 revocable cpus (that means 8 total!)    The problem is due to the way we calculate 'allocated' resource in allocator when 'updateSlave'. If the framework is not registered, the 'allocation' below is not accurate (check that if block in 'addSlave').    {code}  template <class RoleSorter, class FrameworkSorter>  void  HierarchicalAllocatorProcess<RoleSorter, FrameworkSorter>::updateSlave(      const SlaveID& slaveId,      const Resources& oversubscribed)  {    CHECK(initialized);    CHECK(slaves.contains(slaveId));      // Check that all the oversubscribed resources are revocable.

This is due to the fact that the '--ip' flags sets the environment variable `LIBPROCESS_IP` to the passed IP. The executor then inherits this environment variable and is forced to bind to the Slave IP.    If an executor is running in its own containerized environment, with a separate IP than that of the Slave, currently there is no way of forcing it to bind to its own IP.

MESOS-3067,"Implement a streaming response decoder for events stream","We need a streaming response decoder to de-serialize chunks sent from the master on the events stream.

MESOS-3072,"Unify initialization of modularized components","h1.Introduction    As it stands right now, default implementations of modularized components are required to have a non parametrized {{create()}} static method. This allows to write tests which can cover default implementations and modules based on these default implementations on a uniform way.    For example, with the interface {{Foo}}:    {code}  class Foo {  public:    virtual ~Foo() {}      virtual Future<int> hello() = 0;    protected:    Foo() {}  };  {code}    With a default implementation:    {code}  class LocalFoo {  public:    Try<Foo*> create() {      return new Foo;    }      virtual Future<int> hello() {      return 1;    }  };  {code}    This allows to create typed tests which look as following:    {code}  typedef ::testing::Types<LocalFoo,                           tests::Module<Foo, TestLocalFoo>>    FooTestTypes;    TYPED_TEST_CASE(FooTest, FooTestTypes);    TYPED_TEST(FooTest, ATest)  {    Try<Foo*> foo = TypeParam::create();    ASSERT_SOME(foo);      AWAIT_CHECK_EQUAL(foo.get()->hello(), 1);  }  {code}    The test will be applied to each of types in the template parameters of {{FooTestTypes}}. This allows to test different implementation of an interface. In our code, it tests default implementations and a module which uses the same default implementation.    The class {{tests::Module<typename T, ModuleID N>}} needs a little explanation, it is a wrapper around {{ModuleManager}} which allows the tests to encode information about the requested module in the type itself instead of passing a string to the factory method. The wrapper around create, the real important method looks as follows:    {code}  template<typename T, ModuleID N>  static Try<T*> test::Module<T, N>::create()  {    Try<std::string> moduleName = getModuleName(N);    if (moduleName.isError()) {      return Error(moduleName.error());    }    return mesos::modules::ModuleManager::create<T>(moduleName.get());  }  {code}    h1.The Problem    Consider the following implementation of {{Foo}}:    {code}  class ParameterFoo {  public:    Try<Foo*> create(int i) {      return new ParameterFoo(i);    }      ParameterFoo(int i) : i_(i) {}      virtual Future<int> hello() {      return i;    }    private:    int i_;  };  {code}    As it can be seen, this implementation cannot be used as a default implementation since its create API does not match the one of {{test::Module<>}}: {{create()}} has a different signature for both types. It is still a common situation to require initialization parameters for objects, however this constraint (keeping both interfaces alike) forces default implementations of modularized components to have default constructors, therefore the tests are forcing the design of the interfaces.    Implementations which are supposed to be used as modules only, i.e. non default implementations are allowed to have constructor parameters, since the actual signature of their factory method is, this factory method's function is to decode the parameters and call the appropriate constructor:    {code}  template<typename T>  T* Module<T>::create(const Parameters& params);  {code}    where parameters is just an array of key-value string pairs whose interpretation is left to the specific module. Sadly, this call is wrapped by   {{ModuleManager}} which only allows module parameters to be passed from the command line and does not offer a programmatic way to feed construction parameters to modules.    h1.The Ugly Workaround    With the requirement of a default constructor and parameters devoid {{create()}} factory function, a common pattern (see [Authenticator|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/9d4ac11ed757aa5869da440dfe5343a61b07199a/include/mesos/authentication/authenticator.hpp]) has been introduced to feed construction parameters into default implementation, this leads to adding an {{initialize()}} call to the public interface, which will have {{Foo}} become:    {code}  class Foo {  public:    virtual ~Foo() {}      virtual Try<Nothing> initialize(Option<int> i) = 0;      virtual Future<int> hello() = 0;    protected:    Foo() {}  };  {code}    {{ParameterFoo}} will thus look as follows:    {code}  class ParameterFoo {  public:    Try<Foo*> create() {      return new ParameterFoo;    }      ParameterFoo() : i_(None()) {}      virtual Try<Nothing> initialize(Option<int> i) {      if (i.isNone()) {        return Error(""Need value to initialize"");      }        i_ = i;        return Nothing;    }      virtual Future<int> hello() {      if (i_.isNone()) {        return Future<int>::failure(""Not initialized"");      }        return i_.get();    }    private:    Option<int> i_;  };  {code}    Look that this {{initialize()}} method now has to be implemented by all descendants of {{Foo}}, even if there's a {{DatabaseFoo}} which takes is  return value for {{hello()}} from a DB, it will need to support {{int}} as an initialization parameter.    The problem is more severe the more specific the parameter to {{initialize()}} is. For example, if there is a very complex structure implementing ACLs, all implementations of an authorizer will need to import this structure even if they can completely ignore it.    In the {{Foo}} example if {{ParameterFoo}} were to become the default implementation of {{Foo}}, the tests would look as follows:    {code}  typedef ::testing::Types<ParameterFoo,                           tests::Module<Foo, TestParameterFoo>>    FooTestTypes;    TYPED_TEST_CASE(FooTest, FooTestTypes);    TYPED_TEST(FooTest, ATest)  {    Try<Foo*> foo = TypeParam::create();    ASSERT_SOME(foo);      int fooValue = 1;    foo.get()->initialize(fooValue);      AWAIT_CHECK_EQUAL(foo.get()->hello(), fooValue);  }  {code}",3

MESOS-3098,"Implement WindowsContainerizer and WindowsDockerContainerizer","The MVP for Windows support is a containerizer that (1) runs on Windows, and (2) runs and passes all the tests that are relevant to the Windows platform (_e.g._, not the tests that involve cgroups). To do this we require at least a `WindowsContainerizer` (to be implemented alongside the `MesosContainerizer`), which provides no meaningful (_e.g._) process namespacing (much like the default unix containerizer). In the long term (hopefully before MesosCon) we want to support also the Windows container API. This will require implementing a separate containerizer, maybe called `WindowsDockerContainerizer`.    Since the Windows container API is actually officially supported through the Docker interface (_i.e._, MSFT actually ported the Docker engine to Windows, and that is the official API), the interfaces (like the fetcher) shouldn't change much. The tests probably will have to change, as we don't have access to any isolation primitives like cgroups for those tests.

MESOS-3105,"Port flag generation logic from the autotools solution to CMake","One major barrier to widespread adoption of the CMake-based build system (other than the fact that we haven't implemented it yet!) is that most of our institutional knowledge of the quirks of how to build Mesos across many platforms is tied up in files like `configure.ac`.    Therefore, a ""good"" CMake-based build system will require us to go through these files systematically and manually port this logic to CMake (as well as testing it).",3
MESOS-3106,"Extend CMake build system to support building against third-party libraries from either the system or the local Mesos rebundling","Currently Mesos has third-party dependencies of two types: (1) those that are expected to be on the system (such as APR, libsvn, _etc_.), and (2) those that have been historically bundled as tarballs inside the Mesos repository, and are not expected to be on the system when Mesos is installed (these are located in the `3rdparty/` directory, and includes things like boost and glog).    For type (2), the MVP of the CMake-based build system will always pull down a fresh tarball from an external source, instead of using the bundled tarballs in the `3rdparty/` folder.    However, many CI systems do not have Internet access, so in the long term, we need to provide many options for getting these dependencies.",5
MESOS-3107,"Define CMake style guide","The short story is that it is important to be principled about how the CMake build system is maintained, because there CMake language makes it difficult to statically verify that a configuration is correct. It is not unique in this regard, but (make is arguably even worse) but it is something that's important to make sure we get right.    The longer story is, CMake's language is dynamically scoped and often has somewhat odd defaults for variable values (_e.g._, IIRC, target names passed to ExternalProject_Add default to ""PREFIX"" instead of erroring out). This means that it is rare to get a configuration-time error (_i.e._, CMake usually doesn't say something like ""hey this variable isn't defined""), and in large projects, this can make it very difficult to know where definitions come from, or whether it's important that one config routine runs before another. Dynamic scoping also makes it particularly easy to write spaghetti code, which is clearly undesirable for something as important as a build system.    Thus, it is particularly important that we lay down our expectations for how the CMake system is to be structured. This might include:    * Function naming (_e.g._, making it easy to tell whether a function was defined by us, and where it was defined; so we might say that we want our functions to have an underscore to start, and start with the package the come from, like libprocess, so that we know where to look for the definition.)  * What assertions we want to check variable values against, so that we can replace subtle errors (_e.g._, a library is accidentally named something silly like ""PREFIX.0.0.1"") with an obvious ones (_e.g._, ""You have failed to define your target name, so CMake has defaulted to 'PREFIX'; please check your configuration routines"")  * Decisions of what goes where. (_e.g._, the most complex parts of the CMake MVPs is in the configuration routines, like `MesosConfigure.cmake`; to curb this, we should have strict rules about what goes in that file vs other files, and how we know what is to be run before what. Part of this should probably be prominent comments explaining the structure of the project, so that people aren't confused!)  * And so on.",3
MESOS-3108,"Add autotools-style Mesos distributions to the CMake build system","In the autoconf-based build system, we there is a notion of building a ""distribution"" of Mesos. Essentially, it is a version of Mesos that is configured for a specific platform (Ubuntu, say); so, if a consumer knows their platform, and there is a Mesos distribution, they need only run `make all` and Mesos builds. This allows the consumer to skip the configure step.    In CMake, it should be possible to do this (should be!), and we should explore making it work after we complete the MVP.",3
MESOS-3109,"Expand CMake build system to support building the containerizer and associated components","In other tasks in epic MESOS-898, we implement a CMake-based build system that allows us to build process library, the process tests, and the stout tests.    For the CMake build system MVP, it's important that we expand this to build the containerizer, associated modules, and all related tests.",3
MESOS-3110,"Harden the CMake system-dependency-locating routines","Currently the Mesos project has two flavors of dependency: (1) the dependencies we expect are already on the system (_e.g._, apr, libsvn), and (2) the dependencies that are historically bundled with Mesos (_e.g._, glog).    Dependency type (1) requires solid modules that will locate them on any system: Linux, BSD, or Windows. This would come for free if we were using CMake 3.0, but we're using CMake 2.8 so that Ubuntu users can install it out of the box, instead of upgrading CMake first.    This is additionally useful for dependency type (2), where we will expect to have to use these routines when we support both the rebundled dependencies in the `3rdparty/` folder, and system installations of those dependencies.",3
MESOS-3112,"Fetcher should perform cache eviction based on cache file usage patterns.","Currently, the fetcher uses a trivial strategy to select eviction victims: it picks the first cache file it finds in linear iteration.

MESOS-3139,"Incorporate CMake into standard documentation","Right now it's anyone's guess how to build with CMake. If we want people to use it, we should put up documentation. The central challenge is that the CMake instructions will be slightly different for different platforms.    For example, on Linux, the gist of the build is basically the same as autotools; you pull down the system dependencies (like APR, _etc_.), and then:    ```  ./bootstrap  mkdir build-cmake && cd build-cmake  cmake ..  make  ```    But, on Windows, it will be somewhat more complicated. There is no bootstrap step, for example, because Windows doesn't have bash natively. And even when we put that in, you'll still have to build the glog stuff out-of-band because CMake has no way of booting up Visual Studio and calling ""build.""    So practically, we need to figure out:    * What our build story is for different platforms  * Write specific instructions for our ""core"" target platforms.",13

In gmock 1.7  {code}  template <typename T>  inline T Invalid() {    return const_cast<typename remove_reference<T>::type&>(        *static_cast<volatile typename remove_reference<T>::type*>(NULL));  }  {code}    Add volatile could avoid this warning. https://goo.gl/opCiLC    ",3
MESOS-3142,"As a Developer I want a better way to run shell commands","When reviewing the code in [r/36425|https://reviews.apache.org/r/36425/] [~benjaminhindman] noticed that there is a better abstraction that is possible to introduce for {{os::shell()}} that will simplify the caller's life.    Instead of having to handle all possible outcomes, we propose to refactor {{os::shell()}} as follows:    {code}  /**   * Returns the output from running the specified command with the shell.   */  Try<std::string> shell(const string& command)  {    // Actually handle the WIFEXITED, WIFSIGNALED here!  }  {code}    where the returned string is {{stdout}} and, should the program be signaled, or exit with a non-zero exit code, we will simply return a {{Failure}} with an error message that will encapsulate both the returned/signaled state, and, possibly {{stderr}}.    And some test driven development:  {code}  EXPECT_ERROR(os::shell(""false""));  EXPECT_SOME(os::shell(""true""));    EXPECT_SOME_EQ(""hello world"", os::shell(""echo hello world""));  {code}    Alternatively, the caller can ask to have {{stderr}} conflated with {{stdout}}:  {code}  Try<string> outAndErr = os::shell(""myCmd --foo 2>&1"");  {code}    However, {{stderr}} will be ignored by default:  {code}  // We don't read standard error by default.  EXPECT_SOME_EQ("""", os::shell(""echo hello world 1>&2""));    // We don't even read stderr if something fails (to return in Try::error).  Try<string> output = os::shell(""echo hello world 1>&2 && false"");  EXPECT_ERROR(output);  EXPECT_FALSE(strings::contains(output.error(), ""hello world""));  {code}    An analysis of existing usage shows that in almost all cases, the caller only cares {{if not error}}; in fact, the actual exit code is read only once, and even then, in a test case.    We believe this will simplify the API to the caller, and will significantly reduce the length and complexity at the calling sites (<6 LOC against the current 20+).",2
MESOS-3143,"Disable endpoints rule fails to recognize HTTP path delegates","In mesos, one can use the flag {{--firewall_rules}} to disable endpoints. Disabled endpoints will return a _403 Forbidden_ response whenever someone tries to access endpoints.    Libprocess support adding one default delegate for endpoints, which is the default process id which handles endpoints if no process id was given. For example, the default id of the master libprocess process is {{master}} which is also set as the delegate for the master system process, so a request to the endpoint {{http://master-address:5050/state.json}} will effectively be resolved by {{http://master-address:5050/master/state.json}}.

MESOS-3165,"Persist and recover quota to/from Registry","To persist quotas across failovers, the Master should save them in the registry. To support this, we shall:  * Introduce a Quota state variable in registry.proto;  * Extend the Operation interface so that it supports a ‘Quota’ accumulator (see src/master/registrar.hpp);  * Introduce AddQuota / RemoveQuota operations;  * Recover quotas from the registry on failover to the Master’s internal::master::Role struct;  * Extend RegistrarTest with quota-specific tests.    NOTE: Registry variable can be rather big for production clusters (see MESOS-2075). While it should be fine for MVP to add quota information to registry, we should consider storing Quota separately, as this does not need to be in sync with slaves update. However, currently adding more variable is not supported by the registrar.    While the Agents are reregistering (note they may fail to do so), the information about what part of the quota is allocated is only partially available to the Master. In other words, the state of the quota allocation is reconstructed as Agents reregister. During this period, some roles may be under quota from the perspective of the newly elected Master.    The same problem exists on the allocator side: it may think the cluster is under quota and may eagerly try to satisfy quotas before enough Agents reregister, which may result in resources being allocated to frameworks beyond their quota. To address this issue and also to avoid panicking and generating under quota alerts, the Master should give a certain amount of time for the majority (e.g. 80%) of the Agents to reregister before reporting any quota status and notifying the allocator about granted quotas.",5

The drawback of this approach is that it potentially pollutes the host mount table which requires cleanup logics.    For instance, in the test, we create a test rootfs by copying the host files. We need to do a self bind mount so that we can pivot_root on it.

In order to achieve this, it requires to execute the ""perf --version"" command.     We should decompose the existing Subcommand processing in perf so that we can share the implementation between the multiple uses of perf.",3

MESOS-3191,"Implement a utility for computing hash","It is useful for both appc and docker to compute and verify image hash.",2
MESOS-3192,"ContainerInfo::Image::AppC::id should be optional","As I commented here: https://reviews.apache.org/r/34136/    Currently ContainerInfo::Image::Appc is defined as the following    {noformat:title=}      message AppC {        required string name = 1;        required string id = 2;        optional Labels labels = 3;      }  {noformat}    In which the {{id}} is a required field. When users specify the image in tasks they likely will not use an image id (much like when you use docker or rkt to launch containers, you often use {{ubuntu}} or {{ubuntu:latest}} and seldom a SHA512 ID) and we should change it to be optional.    The motivating scenario is that: if the frameworks in the Mesos use something like {{image=ubuntu:14.04""}} to run a task and {{image=ubuntu}} defaults to {{image=ubuntu:latest}}, the operator can swap the latest version for all new tasks requesting {{image=ubuntu}}. If they allow users to specify {{image=ubuntu:live}}, they can swap the live version under the covers as well. This allows the operator to release important image updates (e.g., security patches) and have it picked up by new tasks in the cluster without asking the users to update their job/task configs.",1
MESOS-3193,"Implement AppC image discovery.","Appc spec specifies two image discovery mechanisms: simple and meta discovery. We need to have an abstraction for image discovery in AppcStore. For MVP, we can implement the simple discovery first.    https://reviews.apache.org/r/34139/",2
MESOS-3194,"Implement a 'read-only' AppC Image Store","It's going to be derived from this: https://reviews.apache.org/r/34140/ (and other related patches) but in the initial 'read-only' version the store's content is prepared by out-of-band mechanisms so the store component in Mesos only needs to provide access to images already in it and recover images upon slave restart.    This greatly simplifies the initial version's responsibility and test cases. Features that fetch the images into the store will be added later and they will take into consideration its impact on task start latency and slave restart responsiveness, etc.",5

Only checkpointing the root filesystem for ContainerInfo::image does not make sense.

For example, in our abstractions like Try, rather than being able to say {{Either<Error, Value> t}} we must encode two Options ({{Option<Error>}}, {{Option<T>}}) with the implicit invariant that exactly one will be set.    This also comes in handy in many other places in the code. Note that we have the ability to (1) use C++11 unions now, as well as (2) use boost's variant directly instead of introducing Either. However, creating a named union every time this is needed is verbose, and unions require that we externally track which member is set. For variant, we already use this (e.g. json.hpp), but we can benefit from the better naming as Either.    Many languages expose Either as having only two values, left and right.

MESOS-3280,"Master fails to access replicated log after network partition","In a 5 node cluster with 3 masters and 2 slaves, and ZK on each node, when a network partition is forced, all the masters apparently lose access to their replicated log.

Add query string param to exclude completed tasks from state.json and use it in mesos-dns and similar tools. There is no need for mesos-dns to know about completed tasks, it's just extra load on master and mesos-dns.    2. Make history size configurable.    3. Make JSON serialization faster. With 10000s of tasks even without history it would take a lot of time to serialize tasks for mesos-dns. Doing it every 60 seconds instead of every 5 seconds isn't really an option.    4. Create event bus for mesos master. Marathon has it and it'd be nice to have it in Mesos. This way mesos-dns could avoid polling master state and switch to listening for events.    All can be done independently.    Note to mesosphere folks: please start distributing debug symbols with your distribution.

MESOS-3308,"Define the container rootfs directories within the slave work_dir.","A few motivations:    1) Given the design in MESOS-3004 it became apparent that we need to support multiple images in a container and these images can be of different image types. (There are no sufficient reasons or major obstacles that force us not to allow it and it obviously gives the users more flexibility).    2) Also, even though we currently allow only one backend for each provisioner, when we update a running slave there can be multiple backends left in each container that we need to launch tasks with, or at least recover. We should evaluate in the future whether to support multiple backends and choose among them dynamically based on image characteristics.    3) Since the rootfs' lifecycle tie with the running containers and should be cleaned up after containers die, it fits into the pattern of {{word_dir}} and we can manage them inside the work dir without needing to ask the operator to specify more flags.

This solves the issue that the command executor is not launchable in the user specified root filesystem.

MESOS-3312,"Factor out JSON to repeated protobuf conversion","In general, we have the collection of protobuf messages as another protobuf message, which makes JSON -> protobuf conversion straightforward. This is not always the case, for example, {{Resources}} class is not a protobuf, though protobuf-convertible.    To facilitate conversions like JSON -> {{Resources}} and avoid writing code for each particular case, we propose to introduce {{JSON::Array}} -> {{repeated protobuf}} conversion. With this in place, {{JSON::Array}} -> {{Resources}} boils down to {{JSON::Array}} -> {{repeated Resource}} -> (extra c-tor call) -> {{Resources}}.",2

The solution needs to enable the operator to prefetch a list of ""preferred images"" without introducing the above problems.",5
MESOS-3425,"Modify LinuxLauncher to support Systemd","Implement the solution described in MESOS-3352 in the LinuxLauncher    In order to avoid the migration of cgroup pids by Systemd we can use the {{delegate=true}} flag. This guards Systemd from migrating the pids that are descendants of the process launched by a Systemd unit.    In order for this strategy to work, the {{delegate}} flag must be supported by the Systemd version. Support for this was introduced in Systemd v218; however, it has also been backported to v208 for RHEL7 and CentOS7 [here|http://centoserrata.nagater.net/item/CEBA-2015-0037-CentOS-7.i386.x86_64.html] with the package [systemd-208-20|https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2015-1155.html]. It is highly recommended to upgrade to this package if running those operating systems.    Once the {{delegate=true}} flag has been set, the cgroups that are manually manipulated by the agent will no longer be migrated *during the lifetime of the agent*.    This still leaves the problem of tasks being migrated _after the agent has stopped running_ (voluntarily or not). In order to deal with the problem we propose the following solution:    If an agent is running on a Systemd initialized machine, then the agent will create a Systemd slice with a life-time that is independent of the agent and {{delegate=true}}. The linux launcher (used when cgroups isolators are enabled) will then assign the cgroup name for any executor that is launched to this separate slice. The consequence of this is that when the agent unit is terminated, the separate slice will continue to delegate the cgroups preventing Systemd from migrating the pids. A side benefit of this is that we can maintain the {{KillMode=control-group}} flag on the agent and terminate all agent specific services such as the {{fetcher}} without terminating the tasks. This provides for a nice clean-up.    This solution will still require that the agent unit be launched with the {{delegate=true}} flag such that there is no race during the transition of the pids from the agent to the separate slice.    The agent will be responsible for verifying the slice is still available upon recovery, and warning the operator if it notices that the tasks it is recovering are no longer associated with this separate slice, as this can cause *silent* loss of isolation of existing tasks.",8

(There's some loss, but the conversion is still as good/bad as it was with doubles.)    This problem is due to a limitation in the JSON parsing library we use (PicoJSON), which parses integers as {{int64_t}}.    Some possible solutions or things to investigate:  * We can patch PicoJSON to parse some large values as {{uint64_t}}.  * We can investigate using another parsing library.  * If we want extra precision beyond 64 or 80 bits per double, one possibility is the [GMP library|https://gmplib.org/].

MESOS-3455,"Higher level construct for expressing process dispatch","Since mesos code is based on the actor model and dispatching an interface    asynchronously is a large part of the code base, generalizing the concept of    asynchronously dispatching an interface would eliminate the need to manual    programming of the dispatch boilerplate.    An example usage:    For a simple interface like:    {code}  class Interface                                                                    {                                                                                    virtual Future<size_t> writeToFile(const char* data) = 0;                          virtual ~Interface();                                                            };         {code}    Today the developer has to do the following:    a.

Less bugs.  Focus on real problem and not boilerplate.  ",6

MESOS-3467,"Provide the users with a fully writable filesystem","In the first phase of filesystem provisioning and isolation we are disallowing (or at least should, especially in the case of CopyBackend) users to write outside the sandbox without explicitly mounting specific volumes into the container. We do this even when OverlayBackend can potentially support a empty writable top layer.    However in the real world use of containers (and for people coming from the VM world), users and applications often are used to being able to write to the full filesystem (restricted by plain file system permissions) with reasons ranging from applications being non-portable (filesystem-wise) to the need to do custom installs at run time to system directories (inside its container).    In general, it's a good practice to restrict the application to write to confined locations and software dependencies can be managed through pre-packaged layers but these often introduce a high entry barrier for users.    We should discuss a solution that gives the users the option to write to a full filesystem with a filesystem layer on top of provisioned images and optionally enable persistence of that layer through persistent volumes.

The Austin Group recently proposed changes to POSIX to require that the EINTR case need a retry, but EINPROGRESS be used for when a retry should not occur:    http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=529    However, Linux does not follow this and so we need to remove our EINTR retries.

MESOS-3583,"Introduce stream IDs in HTTP Scheduler API","Currently, the HTTP Scheduler API has no concept of Sessions aka {{SessionID}} or a {{TokenID}}. This is useful in some failure scenarios. As of now, if a framework fails over and then subscribes again with the same {{FrameworkID}} with the {{force}} option set, the Mesos master would subscribe it.    If the previous instance of the framework/scheduler tries to send a Call , e.g. {{Call::KILL}} with the same previous {{FrameworkID}} set, it would be still accepted by the master leading to erroneously killing a task.    This is possible because we do not have a way currently of distinguishing connections. It used to work in the previous driver implementation due to the master also performing a {{UPID}} check to verify if they matched and only then allowing the call. Following the design process, we will implemented ""stream IDs"" for Mesos HTTP schedulers; each ID will be associated with a single subscription connection, and the scheduler must include it as a header in all non-subscribe calls sent to the master.",5

MESOS-3587,"Framework failover when framework is 'active' does not trigger allocation.","FWICT, this is just a consequence of some technical debt in the master code. When an active framework fails over, we do not go through the deactivation->activation code paths, and so:    (1) The framework's filters in the allocator remain after the failover.  (2) The failed over framework does not receive an immediate allocation (it has to wait for the next allocation interval).    If the framework had disconnected first, then the failover goes through the deactivation->activation code paths.    This also means that some tests take longer to run than necessary.",5

A pull request has been filed for this change at https://github.com/kazuho/picojson/pull/70 and if it's merged, we can switch to the two-argument function call.

The requirement here is that responses should be send in the same order as requests are being made.    Libprocess has some mechanisms built in to deal with pipelining when multiple HTTP requests are made, it is still, however, possible to create a situation in which responses are scrambled respected to the requests arrival.    Consider the situation in which there are two libprocess processes, {{processA}} and {{processB}}, each running in a different thread, {{thread2}} and {{thread3}} respectively. The [{{ProcessManager}}|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/1d68eed9089659b06a1e710f707818dbcafeec52/3rdparty/libprocess/src/process.cpp#L374] runs in {{thread1}}.    {{processA}} is of type {{ProcessA}} which looks roughly as follows:    {code}  class ProcessA : public ProcessBase<ProcessA>  {  public:    ProcessA() {}      Future<http::Response> foo(const http::Request&) {      // … Do something …     return http::Ok();    }    protected:    virtual void initialize() {      route(""/foo"", None(), &ProcessA::foo);    }  }  {code}    {{processB}} is from type {{ProcessB}} which is just like {{ProcessA}} but routes {{""bar""}} instead of {{""foo""}}.    The situation in which the bug arises is the following:    # Two requests, one for {{""http://server_uri/(1)/foo""}} and one for {{""http://server_uri/(2)//bar""}} are made over the same socket.  # The first request arrives to [{{ProcessManager::handle}}|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/1d68eed9089659b06a1e710f707818dbcafeec52/3rdparty/libprocess/src/process.cpp#L2202] which is still running in {{thread1}}.

MESOS-3785,"Use URI content modification time to trigger fetcher cache updates.","Instead of using checksums to trigger fetcher cache updates, we can for starters use the content modification time (mtime), which is available for a number of download protocols, e.g. HTTP and HDFS.    Proposal: Instead of just fetching the content size, we fetch both size  and mtime together. As before, if there is no size, then caching fails and we fall back on direct downloading to the sandbox.     Assuming a size is given, we compare the mtime from the fetch URI with the mtime known to the cache. If it differs, we update the cache. (As a defensive measure, a difference in size should also trigger an update.)     Not having an mtime available at the fetch URI is simply treated as a unique valid mtime value that differs from all others. This means that when initially there is no mtime, cache content remains valid until there is one. Thereafter,  anew lack of an mtime invalidates the cache once. In other words: any change from no mtime to having one or back is the same as encountering a new mtime.    Note that this scheme does not require any new protobuf fields.  ",5

There is currently no clear way to tell if this is the case when looking at a response, so the user may incorrectly interpret the agent as being empty of tasks.    We could consider exposing the 'state' enum of the agent in the endpoint:    {code}    enum State    {      RECOVERING,   // Slave is doing recovery.

(2) In {{gtest}}, we've got {{EXPECT_EQ}} as well as the {{bool}}-specific versions: {{EXPECT_TRUE}} and {{EXPECT_FALSE}}.    We should adopt this pattern in these helpers as well. Keeping the pattern above in mind, the following are missing:    * {{AWAIT_ASSERT_TRUE_FOR}}  * {{AWAIT_ASSERT_TRUE}}  * {{AWAIT_ASSERT_FALSE_FOR}}  * {{AWAIT_ASSERT_FALSE}}  * {{AWAIT_EXPECT_TRUE_FOR}}  * {{AWAIT_EXPECT_FALSE_FOR}}    (3) There are HTTP response related macros at the bottom of the file, e.g. {{AWAIT_EXPECT_RESPONSE_STATUS_EQ}}, however these are missing their {{ASSERT}} counterparts.    -(4) The reason for (3) presumably is because we reach for {{EXPECT}} over {{ASSERT}} in general due to the test suite crashing behavior of {{ASSERT}}. If this is the case, it would be worthwhile considering whether macros such as {{AWAIT_READY}} should alias {{AWAIT_EXPECT_READY}} rather than {{AWAIT_ASSERT_READY}}.-    (5) There are a few more missing macros, given {{AWAIT_EQ_FOR}} and {{AWAIT_EQ}} which aliases to {{AWAIT_ASSERT_EQ_FOR}} and {{AWAIT_ASSERT_EQ}} respectively, we should also add {{AWAIT_TRUE_FOR}}, {{AWAIT_TRUE}}, {{AWAIT_FALSE_FOR}}, and {{AWAIT_FALSE}} as well.",2

MESOS-4136,"Add a ContainerLogger module that restrains log sizes","One of the major problems this logger module aims to solve is overflowing executor/task log files.  Log files are simply written to disk, and are not managed other than via occasional garbage collection by the agent process (and this only deals with terminated executors).    We should add a {{ContainerLogger}} module that truncates logs as it reaches a configurable maximum size.  Additionally, we should determine if the web UI's {{pailer}} needs to be changed to deal with logs that are not append-only.

MESOS-4240,"Pull provisioner from linux filesystem isolator to Mesos containerizer.","The rationale behind this change is that many of the image specifications (e.g., Docker/Appc) are not just for filesystems. They also specify runtime configurations (e.g., environment variables, volumes, etc) for the container.    Provisioner should return those runtime configurations to the Mesos containerizer and Mesos containerizer will delegate the isolation of those runtime configurations to the relevant isolator.    Here is what it will be look like eventually. We could do those changes in phases:  1) Provisioner will return a ProvisionInfo which includes a 'rootfs' and image specific runtime configurations (could be the Docker/Appc manifest).  2) Then, the Mesos containerizer will generate a ContainerConfig (a protobuf which includes rootfs, sandbox, docker/appc manifest, similar to OCI's host independent config.json) and pass that to each isolator in 'prepare'. Imaging in the future, a DockerRuntimeIsolator takes the docker manifest from ContainerConfig and prepare the container.  3) The isolator's prepare function will return a ContainerLaunchInfo (contains environment variables, namespaces, etc.) which will be used by Mesos containerize to launch containers. Imaging that information will be passed to the launcher in the future.    We can do the renaming (ContainerPrepareInfo -> ContainerLaunchInfo) later.    ",5

In mesos we need to give the operator the ability to fix the 16-bit major handle used in an agent. Fixing the parent handle on the agent allows operators to install default firewall rules using the parent handle to enforce a default policy (say DENY ALL) for all container traffic till the container is allocated a minor handle.     A simple way to achieve this requirement is to pass the major handle as a flag to the agent at startup. ",1

There can be a total of 64K such network handles.  b) On startup, learn the allocated network handle by walking the net_cls cgroup tree for mesos and build a map of free network handles available to the agent.

MESOS-4441,"Allocate revocable resources beyond quota guarantee.","h4. Status Quo  Currently resources allocated to frameworks in a role with quota (aka quota'ed role) beyond quota guarantee are marked non-revocable. This impacts our flexibility for revoking them if we decide so in the future.    h4. Proposal  Once quota guarantee is satisfied we must not necessarily further allocate resources as non-revocable. Instead we can mark all offers resources beyond guarantee as revocable. When in the future {{RevocableInfo}} evolves frameworks will get additional information about ""revocability"" of the resource (i.e. allocation slack)    h4. Caveats  Though it seems like a simple change, it has several implications.    h6. Fairness  Currently the hierarchical allocator considers revocable resources as regular resources when doing fairness calculations. This may prevent frameworks getting non-revocable resources as part of their role's quota guarantee if they accept some revocable resources as well.    Consider the following scenario. A single framework in a role with quota set to {{10}} CPUs is allocated {{10}} CPUs as non-revocable resources as part of its quota and additionally {{2}} revocable CPUs. Now a task using {{2}} non-revocable CPUs finishes and its resources are returned. Total allocation for the role is {{8}} non-revocable + {{2}} revocable. However, the role may not be offered additional {{2}} non-revocable since its total allocation satisfies quota.    h6. Resource math  If we allocate non-revocable resources as revocable, we should make sure we do accounting right: either we should update total agent resources and mark them as revocable as well, or bookkeep resources as non-revocable and convert them to revocable when necessary.    h6. Coarse-grained nature of allocation  The hierarchical allocator performs ""coarse-grained"" allocation, meaning it always allocates the entire remaining agent resources to a single framework. This may lead to over-allocating some resources as non-revocable beyond quota guarantee.    h6. Quotas smaller than fair share  If a quota set for a role is smaller than its fair share, it may reduce the amount of resources offered to this role, if frameworks in it do not accept revocable resources. This is probably the most important consequence of the proposed change. Operators may set quota to get guarantees, but may observe a decrease in amount of resources a role gets, which is not intuitive.",8

Examples would be IP address allocation to a container by the 'network isolator, or net_cls handle allocation by the cgroup/net_cls isolator.     Often times the state of the container, needs to be exposed to operators through the state.json end-point. For e.g. operators or frameworks might want to know the IP-address configured on a particular container, or the net_cls handle associated with a container to configure the right TC rules. However, at present, there is no clean interface for the slave to retrieve the state of a container from the Containerizer for any of the launched containers. Thus, we need to introduce a `status` interface in the `Containerizer` base class, in order for the slave to expose container state information in its state.json.   ",2
MESOS-4488,"Define a CgroupInfo protobuf to expose cgroup isolator configuration.","Within `MesosContainerizer` we have an isolator associated with each linux cgroup subsystem. The isolators apply subsystem specific configuration on the containers before launching the containers. For e.g cgroup/net_cls isolator applies net_cls handles, cgroup/mem isolator applies memory quotas, cgroups/cpu-share isolator configures cpu shares.     Currently, there is no message structure defined to capture the configuration information of the container, for each cgroup isolator that has been applied to the container. We therefore need to define a protobuf that can capture the cgroup configuration of each cgroup isolator that has been applied to the container. This protobuf will be filled in by the cgroup isolator and will be stored as part of `ContainerConfig` in the containerizer. ",1
MESOS-4489,"The `cgroups/net_cls` isolator needs to expose handles in the ContainerStatus","The `cgroup/net_cls` isolator is responsible for allocating network handles to containers launched within a net_cls cgroup. The `cgroup/net_cls` isolator needs to expose these handles to the containerizer as part of the `ContainerStatus` when the containerizer queries the status() method of the isolator. The information itself will go as part of a `CgroupInfo` protobuf that will be defined as part of MESOS-4488 .  ",1
MESOS-4490,"Get container status information in slave. ","As part of MESOS-4487 an interface will be introduce into the `Containerizer` to allow agents to retrieve container state information. The agent needs to use this interface to retrieve container state information during status updates from the executor. The container state information can be then use by the agent to expose various isolator specific configuration (for e.g., IP address allocated by network isolators, net_cls handles allocated by `cgroups/net_cls` isolator), that has been applied to the container, in the state.json endpoint.

MESOS-4505,"Hierarchical allocator performance is slow due to Quota","Since we do not strip the non-scalar resources during the resource arithmetic for quota, the performance can degrade significantly, as currently resource arithmetic is expensive.    One approach to resolving this is to filter the resources we use to perform this arithmetic to only use scalars. This is valid as quota can currently only be set for scalar resource types.",3
MESOS-4506,"Posix disk isolator should ignore disk quota enforcement for MOUNT type disk resources.","We assume MOUNT type disk is exclusive and the underlying filesystem will enforce the quota (i.e., the application won't be able to exceed the quota, and will get a write error it the disk is full).    Therefore, there's no need to enforce it's quota in posix disk isolator.",2
MESOS-4512,"Render quota status consistently with other endpoints.","Currently quota status endpoint returns a collection of {{QuotaInfo}} protos converted to JSON. An example response looks like this:  {code:xml}  {    ""infos"": [      {        ""role"": ""role1"",        ""guarantee"": [          {            ""name"": ""cpus"",            ""role"": ""*"",            ""type"": ""SCALAR"",            ""scalar"": { ""value"": 12 }          },          {            ""name"": ""mem"",            ""role"": ""*"",            ""type"": ""SCALAR"",            ""scalar"": { ""value"": 6144 }          }        ]      }    ]  }  {code}    Presence of some fields, e.g. ""role"", is misleading.

The agent when it comes up the first time, resolves the zk:// string. Once all the hosts that were in the original string fail (Each fails, is replaced by a new machine, which has the same DNS name), the agent just keeps spinning in an internal loop, never re-resolving the DNS names.    Two solutions I see are   1. Update the list of servers / re-resolve  2. Have the agent detect it hasn't connected recently, and kill itself (Which will force a re-resolution when the agent starts back up)",3

This means that if an ACL exists which authorizes a framework's principal to reserve resources, that same principal can be used to reserve resources for _any_ role through the operator endpoint.    We should restrict reservations made through the operator endpoint to specified roles. A few possibilities:  * The {{object}} of the {{reserve_resources}} ACL could be changed from {{resources}} to {{roles}}  * A second ACL could be added for authorization of {{reserve}} operations, with an {{object}} of {{role}}  * Our conception of the {{resources}} object in the {{reserve_resources}} ACL could be expanded to include role information, i.e., {{disk(role1);mem(role1)}}",3

MESOS-4712,"Remove 'force' field from the Subscribe Call in v1 Scheduler API","We/I introduced the `force` field in SUBSCRIBE call to deal with scheduler partition cases. Having thought a bit more and discussing with few other folks ([~anandmazumdar], [~greggomann]), I think we can get away from not having that field in the v1 API. The obvious advantage of removing the field is that framework devs don't have to think about how/when to set the field (the current semantics are a bit confusing).    The new workflow when a master receives a SUBSCRIBE call is that master always accepts this call and closes any existing connection (after sending ERROR event) from the same scheduler (identified by framework id).      The expectation from schedulers is that they must close the old subscribe connection before resending a new SUBSCRIBE call.    Lets look at some tricky scenarios and see how this works and why it is safe.    1) Connection disconnection @ the scheduler but not @ the master       Scheduler sees the disconnection and sends a new SUBSCRIBE call. Master sends ERROR on the old connection (won't be received by the scheduler because the connection is already closed) and closes it.    2) Connection disconnection @ master but not @ scheduler    Scheduler realizes this from lack of HEARTBEAT events. It then closes its existing connection and sends a new SUBSCRIBE call. Master accepts the new SUBSCRIBE call. There is no old connection to close on the master as it is already closed.    3) Scheduler failover but no disconnection @ master    Newly elected scheduler sends a SUBSCRIBE call. Master sends ERROR event and closes the old connection (won't be received because the old scheduler failed over).    4) If Scheduler A got partitioned (but is alive and connected with master) and Scheduler B got elected as new leader.    When Scheduler B sends SUBSCRIBE, master sends ERROR and closes the connection from Scheduler A. Master accepts Scheduler B's connection. Typically Scheduler A aborts after receiving ERROR and gets restarted. After restart it won't become the leader because Scheduler B is already elected.    5) Scheduler sends SUBSCRIBE, times out, closes the SUBSCRIBE connection (A) and sends a new SUBSCRIBE (B). Master receives SUBSCRIBE (B) and then receives SUBSCRIBE (A) but doesn't see A's disconnection yet.    Master first accepts SUBSCRIBE (B). After it receives SUBSCRIBE (A), it sends ERROR to SUBSCRIBE (B) and closes that connection. When it accepts SUBSCRIBE (A) and tries to send SUBSCRIBED event the connection closure is detected. Scheduler retries the SUBSCRIBE connection after a backoff. I think this is a rare enough race for it to happen continuously in a loop.    ",5

Resources might be offered in order to satisfy outstanding quota or for fairness.

My understanding of why this is happening is because the executor was trying to report its status to Mesos slave over HTTPS, but doesnt have the appropriate certs/env setup inside the executor.    (Thanks to mslackbot/joseph for helping me figure this out on #mesos)    It turns out, the executor expects all SSL_* variables to be set inside `CommandInfo.environment` which gets picked up by the executor to successfully reports its status to the slave.    This part of __executor needing all the SSL_* variables to be set in its environment__ is missing in the Mesos SSL transitioning guide.

MESOS-4772,"TaskInfo/ExecutorInfo should include fine-grained ownership/namespacing","We need a way to assign fine-grained ownership to tasks/executors so that multi-user frameworks can tell Mesos to associate the task with a user identity (rather than just the framework principal+role). Then, when an HTTP user requests to view the task's sandbox contents, or kill the task, or list all tasks, the authorizer can determine whether to allow/deny/filter the request based on finer-grained, user-level ownership.  Some systems may want TaskInfo.owner to represent a group rather than an individual user. That's fine as long as the framework sets the field to the group ID in such a way that a group-aware authorizer can interpret it.",2

Also, this behavior does not match what Docker containerizer does.

MESOS-4783,"Disable rate limiting of the global metrics endpoint for mesos-tests execution","Once we can optionally disable rate limiting in the global metrics endpoint with MESOS-4776 we should disable the rate limiting during the execution of mesos-tests.    * rate limiting makes it cumbersome to repeatedly hit the endpoint since one would not want to interfere with the rate limiting  * rate limiting might incur additional wait time which might slown down tests",3

Similarly, we document the master state endpoint as {{/master/state}}, whereas the preferred name is now just {{/state}}, and so on for most of the other endpoints. Unlike we the V1 API, we might want to consider backward compatibility and document both forms -- not sure. But certainly it seems like we should encourage people to use the shorter paths, not the longer ones.",2

MESOS-4820,"Need to set `EXPOSED` ports from docker images into `ContainerConfig`","Most docker images have an `EXPOSE` command associated with them. This tells the container run-time the TCP ports that the micro-service ""wishes"" to expose to the outside world.     With the `Unified containerizer` project since `MesosContainerizer` is going to natively support docker images it is imperative that the Mesos container run time have a mechanism to expose ports listed in a Docker image. The first step to achieve this is to extract this information from the `Docker` image and set in the `ContainerConfig` . The `ContainerConfig` can then be used to pass this information to any isolator (for e.g. `network/cni` isolator) that will install port forwarding rules to expose the desired ports.",1
MESOS-4821,"Introduce a port field in `ImageManifest` in order to set exposed ports for a container.","Networking isolators such as `network/cni` need to learn about ports that a container wishes to be exposed to the outside world.

MESOS-4823,"Implement port forwarding in `network/cni` isolator","Most docker and appc images wish to expose ports that micro-services are listening on, to the outside world. When containers are running on bridged (or ptp) networking this can be achieved by installing port forwarding rules on the agent (using iptables). This can be done in the `network/cni` isolator.     The reason we would like this functionality to be implemented in the `network/cni` isolator, and not a CNI plugin, is that the specifications currently do not support specifying port forwarding rules. Further, to install these rules the isolator needs two pieces of information, the exposed ports and the IP address associated with the container. Bother are available to the isolator.",2

If it receives an explicit `Shutdown` message from the agent.  2. If the recovery timeout period has elapsed, and the executor still hasn’t been able to (re-)connect with the agent.    Currently, the executor library relies on the field `grace_period_seconds` having a default value of 5 seconds to handle the second scenario. https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/src/executor/executor.cpp#L608    The driver used to trigger the grace period via a constant defined in src/slave/constants.cpp. https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/src/exec/exec.cpp#L92    The agent may want to force a shorter shutdown grace period (e.g. oversubscription eviction may have shorter deadline) in the future.

MESOS-4859,"Add explicit upgrade instructions to the docs","The documentation currently contains per-version upgrade guidelines, which for recent releases only outlines the upgrade concerns for that version, without detailing explicit upgrade instructions.    We should add explicit upgrade instructions to the top of the upgrades documentation, which can be supplemented by the per-version concerns.    This is done within the upgrade docs for some early versions, with text like:    {code}  In order to upgrade a running cluster:    Install the new master binaries and restart the masters.  Upgrade the schedulers by linking the latest native library and mesos jar (if necessary).  Restart the schedulers.  Install the new slave binaries and restart the slaves.  Upgrade the executors by linking the latest native library and mesos jar (if necessary).  {code}    Instructions to this effect should be featured prominently in the doc.",1
MESOS-4860,"Add a script to install the Nvidia GDK on a host.","This script can be used to install the Nvidia GDK for Cuda 7.5 on a  mesos development machine. The purpose of the Nvidia GDK is to provide  all the necessary header files (nvml.h) and library files  (libnvidia-ml.so) necessary to build mesos with Nvidia GPU support.    If the machine on which Mesos is being compiled doesn't have any GPUs,  then libnvidia-ml.so consists only of stubs, allowing Mesos to build  and run, but not actually do anything useful under the hood. This  enables us to build a GPU-enabled mesos on a development machine  without GPUs and then deploy it to a production machine with GPUs and  be reasonably sure it will work.",2
MESOS-4861,"Add configure flags to build with Nvidia GPU support.","The configure flags can be used to enable Nvidia GPU support, as well as specify the installation directories of the nvml header and library files if not already installed in standard include/library paths on the system.    They will also be used to conditionally build support for Nvidia GPUs into Mesos.",2
MESOS-4863,"Add Nvidia GPU isolator tests.","We need to be able to run unit tests that verify GPU isolation, as well as run full blown tests that actually exercise the GPUs.    These tests should only build when the proper configure flags are set for enabling nvidia GPU support.",2
MESOS-4864,"Add flag to specify available Nvidia GPUs on an agent's command line.","In the initial GPU support we will not do auto-discovery of GPUs on an agent.  As such, an operator will need to specify a flag on the command line, listing all of the GPUs available on the system.",3
MESOS-4865,"Add GPUs as an explicit resource.","We will add ""gpus"" as an explicitly recognized resource in Mesos, akin to cpus, memory, ports, and disk.  In the containerizer, we will verify that the number of GPU resources passed in via the --resources flag matches the list of GPUs passed in via the --nvidia_gpus flag.  In the future we will add autodiscovery so this matching is unnecessary.  However, we will always have to pass ""gpus"" as a resource to make any GPU available on the system (unlike for cpus and memory, where the default is probed).",3

While working on MESOS-4850, it became apparent that since our tests use the same instance of libprocess for both master and agent, different default authentication realms must be used for master/agent so that HTTP authentication can be independently enabled/disabled for each.    We should establish a mechanism for making an endpoint authenticated that allows us to:  1) Install an endpoint like {{/files}}, whose code is shared by the master and agent, with different authentication realms for the master and agent  2) Avoid hard-coding a default authentication realm into libprocess, to permit the use of different authentication realms for the master and agent and to keep application-level concerns from leaking into libprocess    Another option would be to use a single default authentication realm and always enable or disable HTTP authentication for *both* the master and agent in tests. However, this wouldn't allow us to test scenarios where HTTP authentication is enabled on one but disabled on the other.",5

MESOS-4916,"Allow modules to express if they are multi-instantiable and thread safe.","A module might be instantiated multiple time (e.g., multiple schedulers in the same Java process instantiating an authenticator module) within the same process. The current mechanism doesn't provide a way through the module API to forbid multiple instantiations. It is up to the module to check and return error on prior instantiation.    Along similar lines, a module should be able to express thread-safety concerns. Typically, a module running in Master/Agent doesn't have to be concerned about thread safety if it uses libprocess API. However, we should investigate how it plays in the scheduler environment.",8

MESOS-4950,"Implement reconnect funtionality in the scheduler library.","Currently, there is no way for the schedulers to force a reconnection attempt with the master using the scheduler library {{src/scheduler/scheduler.cpp}}. It is specifically useful in scenarios where there is a one way network partition with the master. Due to this, the scheduler has not received any {{HEARTBEAT}} events from the master. In this case, the scheduler might want to force a reconnection attempt with the master instead of relying on the {{disconnected}} callback.",3
MESOS-4951,"Enable actors to pass an authentication realm to libprocess","To prepare for MESOS-4902, the Mesos master and agent need a way to pass the desired authentication realm to libprocess. Since some endpoints (like {{/profiler/*}}) get installed in libprocess, the master/agent should be able to specify during initialization what authentication realm the libprocess-level endpoints will be authenticated under.",2
MESOS-4956,"Add authentication to /files endpoints","To protect access (authz) to master/agent logs as well as executor sandboxes, we need authentication on the /files endpoints.    Adding HTTP authentication to these endpoints is a bit complicated since they are defined in code that is shared by the master and agent.    While working on MESOS-4850, it became apparent that since our tests use the same instance of libprocess for both master and agent, different default authentication realms must be used for master/agent so that HTTP authentication can be independently enabled/disabled for each.    We should establish a mechanism for making an endpoint authenticated that allows us to:  1) Install an endpoint like {{/files}}, whose code is shared by the master and agent, with different authentication realms for the master and agent  2) Avoid hard-coding a default authentication realm into libprocess, to permit the use of different authentication realms for the master and agent and to keep application-level concerns from leaking into libprocess    Another option would be to use a single default authentication realm and always enable or disable HTTP authentication for *both* the master and agent in tests. However, this wouldn't allow us to test scenarios where HTTP authentication is enabled on one but disabled on the other.",5

Moreover i dont see the runs/container_id in the Mesos Proto Api. I guess this is hidden info, this is the needed piece of info to re-write the uri without redirection.  ",3
MESOS-4998,"Problematic fork/clone performance at high load.","Creating a new subprocess in mesos involves forking/cloning a new process. In most cases (executors, perf, ..) the parent of the new process is the agent/slave process. This can lead to problematic behavior especially when creating several new processes at the same time.    The problem here is that the normal fork() (or clone syscall used by libprocess) provides a copy-on-write (cow) view of the parents address space until the child execs its new binary. Note that during the time between fork and exec Mesos does several setup actions such as placing the new processes in systemd units or assigning them to the freezer cgroup.  This cow property of the address space implies that existing memory is marked as read-only and any write will trigger a page-fault and a newly created page. Note this behavior also extends to the parent process and hence any write will be very costly.    We simulated the number of pagefaults when forking/cloning new processes by this benchmark:  https://github.com/joerg84/forking-benchmark    Results can be seen here:   https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SUjKAVHdrutLPpFJy3Q1yhinG5FOMw3HbbEdzuhZ7A8",8
MESOS-5004,"Clarify docs on '/reserve' and '/create-volumes' without authentication","For both reservations and persistent volume creation, the behavior of the HTTP endpoints differs slightly from that of the framework operations. Due to the implementation of HTTP authentication, it is not possible for a framework/operator to provide a principal when HTTP authentication is disabled. This means that when HTTP authentication is disabled, the endpoint handlers will _always_ receive {{None()}} as the principal associated with the request, and thus if authorization is enabled, the request will only succeed if the NONE principal is authorized to do stuff.    The docs should be updated to explain this behavior explicitly.",1
MESOS-5005,"Enforce that DiskInfo principal is equal to framework/operator principal","Currently, we require that {{ReservationInfo.principal}} be equal to the principal provided for authentication, which means that when HTTP authentication is disabled this field cannot be set. Based on comments in 'mesos.proto', the original intention was to enforce this same constraint for {{Persistence.principal}}, but it seems that we don't enforce it. This should be changed to make the two fields equivalent, with one exception: when the framework/operator principal is {{None}}, we should allow the principal in {{DiskInfo}} to take any value, along the same lines as MESOS-5212.",3

MESOS-5153,"Sandboxes contents should be protected from unauthorized users","MESOS-4956 introduced authentication support for the sandboxes. However, authentication can only go as far as to tell whether an user is known to mesos or not.

MESOS-5155,"Consolidate authorization actions for quota.","We should have just a single authz action: {{UPDATE_QUOTA_WITH_ROLE}}. It was a mistake in retrospect to introduce multiple actions.    Actions that are not symmetrical are register/teardown and dynamic reservations. The way they are implemented in this way is because entities that do one action differ from entities that do the other. For example, register framework is issued by a framework, teardown by an operator. What is a good way to identify a framework? A role it runs in, which may be different each launch and makes no sense in multi-role frameworks setup or better a sort of a group id, which is its principal. For dynamic reservations and persistent volumes, they can be both issued by frameworks and operators, hence similar reasoning applies.     Now, quota is associated with a role and set only by operators. Do we need to care about principals that set it? Not that much. ",5

With the development of the `network/cni` isolator we have an interface to run Mesos on multitude of IP networks. Given that its based on an open standard (the CNI spec) which is gathering a lot of traction from vendors (calico, weave, coreOS) and already works on some default networks (bridge, ipvlan, macvlan) it makes sense to make it as the default network isolator.

The error message is `Unexpected HTTP response '400 Bad Request' when trying to download the blob`. This may arise from the logic of fetching blobs, or incorrect format of uri when requesting blobs.",3
MESOS-5173,"Allow master/agent to take multiple modules manifest files","When loading multiple modules into master/agent, one has to merge all module metadata (library name, module name, parameters, etc.) into a single json file which is then passed on to the --modules flag. This quickly becomes cumbersome especially if the modules are coming from different vendors/developers.    An alternate would be to allow multiple invocations of --modules flag that can then be passed on to the module manager. That way, each flag corresponds to just one module library and modules from that library.    Another approach is to create a new flag (e.g., --modules-dir) that contains a path to a directory that would contain multiple json files. One can think of it as an analogous to systemd units. The operator that drops a new file into this directory and the file would automatically be picked up by the master/agent module manager. Further, the naming scheme can also be inherited to prefix the filename with an ""NN_"" to signify oad order.",3
MESOS-5174,"Update the balloon-framework to run on test clusters","There are a couple of problems with the balloon framework that prevent it from being deployed (easily) on an actual cluster:    * The framework accepts 100% of memory in an offer.  This means the expected behavior (finish or OOM) is dependent on the offer size.  * The framework assumes the {{balloon-executor}} binary is available on each agent.  This is generally only true in the build environment or in single-agent test environments.  * The framework does not specify CPUs with the executor.  This is required by many isolators.  * The executor's {{TASK_FINISHED}} logic path was untested and is flaky.  * The framework has no metrics.  * The framework only launches a single task and then exits.

MESOS-5178,"Add logic to validate for non-fractional GPU requests in the master","We should not put this logic directly into the  'Resources::validate()' function.  The primary reason is that the existing 'Resources::validate()' function doesn't consider the semantics of any particular resource when performing its validation (it only makes sure that the fields in the 'Resource' protobuf message are correctly formed). Since a fractional 'gpus' resources is actually well-formed (and only semantically incorrect), we should push this validation logic up into the master.        Moreover, the existing logic to construct a 'Resources' object from a 'RepeatedPtrField<Resource>' silently drops any resources that don't pass 'Resources::validate()'. This means that if we were to push the non-fractional 'gpus' validation into 'Resources::validate()', the 'gpus' resources would just be silently dropped rather than causing a TASK_ERROR in the master. This is obviously *not* the desired behaviour.",2

MESOS-5180,"Scheduler driver does not detect disconnection with master and reregister.","The existing implementation of the scheduler driver does not re-register with the master under some network partition cases.    When a scheduler registers with the master:  1) master links to the framework  2) framework links to the master    It is possible for either of these links to break *without* the master changing.  (Currently, the scheduler driver will only re-register if the master changes).    If both links break or if just link (1) breaks, the master views the framework as {{inactive}} and {{disconnected}}.  This means the framework will not receive any more events (such as offers) from the master until it re-registers.  There is currently no way for the scheduler to detect a one-way link breakage.    if link (2) breaks, it makes (almost) no difference to the scheduler.  The scheduler usually uses the link to send messages to the master, but libprocess will create another socket if the persistent one is not available.    To fix link breakages for (1+2) and (2), the scheduler driver should implement a `::exited` event handler for the master's {{pid}} and trigger a master (re-)detection upon a disconnection. This in turn should make the driver (re)-register with the master.

MESOS-5239,"Persistent volume DockerContainerizer support assumes proper mount propagation setup on the host.","We recently added persistent volume support in DockerContainerizer (MESOS-3413). To understand the problem, we first need to understand how persistent volumes are supported in DockerContainerizer.    To support persistent volumes in DockerContainerizer, we bind mount persistent volumes under a container's sandbox ('container_path' has to be relative for persistent volumes). When the Docker container is launched, since we always add a volume (-v) for the sandbox, the persistent volumes will be bind mounted into the container as well (since Docker does a 'rbind').    The assumption that the above works is that the Docker daemon should see those persistent volume mounts that Mesos mounts on the host mount table. It's not a problem if Docker daemon itself is using the host mount namespace. However, on systemd enabled systems, Docker daemon is running in a separate mount namespace and all mounts in that mount namespace will be marked as slave mounts due to this [patch|https://github.com/docker/docker/commit/eb76cb2301fc883941bc4ca2d9ebc3a486ab8e0a].    So what that means is that: in order for it to work, the parent mount of agent's work_dir should be a shared mount when docker daemon starts. This is typically true on CentOS7, CoreOS as all mounts are shared mounts by default.    However, this causes an issue with the 'filesystem/linux' isolator. To understand why, first I need to show you a typical problem when dealing with shared mounts. Let me explain that using the following commands on a CentOS7 machine:  {noformat}  [root@core-dev run]# cat /proc/self/mountinfo  24 60 0:19 / /run rw,nosuid,nodev shared:22 - tmpfs tmpfs rw,seclabel,mode=755  [root@core-dev run]# mkdir /run/netns  [root@core-dev run]# mount --bind /run/netns /run/netns  [root@core-dev run]# cat /proc/self/mountinfo  24 60 0:19 / /run rw,nosuid,nodev shared:22 - tmpfs tmpfs rw,seclabel,mode=755  121 24 0:19 /netns /run/netns rw,nosuid,nodev shared:22 - tmpfs tmpfs rw,seclabel,mode=755  [root@core-dev run]# ip netns add test  [root@core-dev run]# cat /proc/self/mountinfo  24 60 0:19 / /run rw,nosuid,nodev shared:22 - tmpfs tmpfs rw,seclabel,mode=755  121 24 0:19 /netns /run/netns rw,nosuid,nodev shared:22 - tmpfs tmpfs rw,seclabel,mode=755  162 121 0:3 / /run/netns/test rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime shared:5 - proc proc rw  163 24 0:3 / /run/netns/test rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime shared:5 - proc proc rw  {noformat}    As you can see above, there're two entries (/run/netns/test) in the mount table (unexpected). This will confuse some systems sometimes. The reason is because when we create a self bind mount (/run/netns -> /run/netns), the mount will be put into the same shared mount peer group (shared:22) as its parent (/run). Then, when you create another mount underneath that (/run/netns/test), that mount operation will be propagated to all mounts in the same peer group (shared:22), resulting an unexpected additional mount being created.    The reason we need to do a self bind mount in Mesos is that sometimes, we need to make sure some mounts are shared so that it does not get copied when a new mount namespace is created. However, on some systems, mounts are private by default (e.g., Ubuntu 14.04). In those cases, since we cannot change the system mounts, we have to do a self bind mount so that we can set mount propagation to shared. For instance, in filesytem/linux isolator, we do a self bind mount on agent's work_dir.    To avoid the self bind mount pitfall mentioned above, in filesystem/linux isolator, after we created the mount, we do a make-slave + make-shared so that the mount is its own shared mount peer group. In that way, any mounts underneath it will not be propagated back.    However, that operation will break the assumption that the persistent volume DockerContainerizer support makes. As a result, we're seeing problem with persistent volumes in DockerContainerizer when filesystem/linux isolator is turned on.",3

This has two problems:  1. Using the same task status for two fairly different situations is confusing.  2. In the partitioned-but-still-running case, frameworks have no easy way to determine when a task has truly terminated.    To address these problems, we propose introducing a new task status, TASK_LOST_PENDING. If a framework opts into this behavior using a new capability, TASK_LOST would mean ""the task is definitely not running"", whereas TASK_LOST_PENDING would mean ""the task may or may not be running (we've lost contact with the agent), but the master will try to shut it down when possible.""",5

However, there are cases when access to these files is appropriate, even when not making use of a GPU. Running `nvidia-smi` to control the global state of the underlying nvidia driver, for example.        We should add `/dev/nvidiactl` and `/dev/nvidia-uvm` to the default whitelist of devices to include in every container when the `gpu/nvidia` isolator is enabled.

Instead, we should use a vector to represent the pairing of isolator name to isolator creator function. This way, the relative dependencies between each isolator will be implicit in the ordering of the vector. Currently, a hashmap is used to hold this pairing, but this is inadequate because hashmaps are inherently unordered. The new implementation using a vector will ensure everything is processed in the order it is listed.",3
MESOS-5582,"Create a `cgroups/devices` isolator.","Currently, all the logic for the `cgroups/devices` isolator is bundled into the Nvidia GPU Isolator. We should abstract it out into it's own component and remove the redundant logic from the Nvidia GPU Isolator. Assuming the guaranteed ordering between isolators from MESOS-5581, we can be sure that the dependency order between the `cgroups/devices` and `gpu/nvidia` isolators is met.",2

This is problematic, because of two reasons:    1. When we use docker images (such as `mongo`) in unified containerizer, duplicated environment variables inherited from the slave lead to initialization failures, because LANG and/or LC_* environment variables are not set correctly.    2. When we are looking at the environment variables from the executor tasks, there are pages of environment variables listed, which is redundant and dangerous.

MESOS-5698,"Quota sorter not updated for resource changes at agent.","Consider this sequence of events:    1. Slave connects, with 128MB of disk.  2. Master offers resources at slave to framework  3. Framework creates a dynamic reservation for 1MB and a persistent volume of the same size on the slave's resources.    => This invokes {{Master::apply}}, which invokes {{allocator->updateAllocation}}, which invokes {{Sorter::update()}} on the framework sorter and role sorter. If the framework's role has a configured quota, it also invokes {{update}} on the quota role sorter -- in this case, the framework's role has no quota, so the quota role sorter is *not* updated.    => {{DRFSorter::update}} updates the *total* resources at a given slave, among updating other state. New total resources will be 127MB of unreserved disk and 1MB of reserved disk with a volume. Note that the quota role sorter still thinks the slave has 128MB of unreserved disk.  4. The slave is removed from the cluster. {{HierarchicalAllocatorProcess::removeSlave}} invokes:    {code}    roleSorter->remove(slaveId, slaves[slaveId].total);    quotaRoleSorter->remove(slaveId, slaves[slaveId].total.nonRevocable());  {code}    {{slaves\[slaveId\].total.nonRevocable()}} is 127MB of unreserved disk and 1MB of reserved disk with a volume. When we remove this from the quota role sorter, we're left with total resources on the reserved slave of 1MB of unreserved disk, since that is the result of subtracting <127MB unreserved, 1MB reserved+volume> from <128MB unreserved>.    The implications of this can't be good: at minimum, we're leaking resources for removed slaves in the quota role sorter. We're also introducing an inconsistency between {{total_.resources\[slaveId\]}} and {{total_.scalarQuantities}}, since the latter has already stripped-out volume/reservation information.",5

By using this header-only library and bundling it with Mesos, we can remove this external dependence altogether.",2
MESOS-5768,"Reimplement the stout ELF abstraction in terms of ELFIO","With the introduction of the new bundled ELFIO library, we need to reimplement our stout ELF abstraction in terms of it.  As part of this, we need to update the tests that use it (i.e. ldcache_test.cpp)",2

As such,      the protobuf for ImageManifest also provides these fields in      snake_case. Unfortunately, the `docker inspect` command also provides      a method of retrieving the JSON for an image manifest, with one major      caveat -- it represents all of its top level keys in CamelCase.            To allow both representations to be parsed in the same way, we      should intercept the incoming JSON from either source (disk or `docker      inspect`) and convert it to a canonical snake_case representation.",3

While the command and docker executors could just use the library to avoid the subprocess complexity, we may want to consider keeping a binary version that ships with the installation, because the intention of the binary was to allow other executors to re-use our implementation. On the other side, this binary is ill suited to this since it uses libprocess message passing, so if we do not have code that requires the binary it seems ok to remove it for now.
