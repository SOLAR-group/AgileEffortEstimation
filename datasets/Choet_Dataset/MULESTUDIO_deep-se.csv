STUDIO-280,"Cannot import a Studio project from Git without errors","Steps to reproduce:    1. Create a simple Mule Studio project (for instance: the Echo example)  2. Push it into GitHub, pull/clone the repository into your local instance  3. Open up a brand new workspace  4. Goto Import/Git/Projects from Git  5. Select the local copy of your GitHub repository  6. Select import existing projects  7. Select the project created above  8. The import fails due to missing directories (see screenshot)    Note that if I do Import --> Mule project it works but then it doesn't recognise that it is a project managed by git so I cannot commit changes.    This is blocking me for the work I am doing with examples.    Edit: workaround: perform a Clean operation on the project.",3

STUDIO-459,"Unable to add a response when creating a second flow in the same mflow","Unable to add a response when creating a second flow.    Steps to reproduce:    1) Open Studio and create a project from an existing template: Order Discounter.  2) In that same mflow file create another flow. Drag and drop HTTP RQ-RS, echo, flow reference, All router and component, echo and file, then file.  3) Try to add a response (echo component) like the one displayed for the template flow.  Unable to add a response, instead of that it lets me add the component between HTTP and SOAP component.    See screen shot.",8
STUDIO-618," Namespaces in the XML view are not being removed when you remove all the elements of a kind","When you add an element and then you remove it, the reference to the schema file is not being removed from the XML namespaces.      Steps to reproduce:   1.- Create a project in Studio with a flow in it and go to the Global Elements tab.   2.- Add for example a global Jetty endpoint with the default values.   3.- Go to the XML view and check that the xml code for the endpoint is there with reference to the mule-jetty.xsd in the namespaces  4.- Go back to the global elements tab and delete the endpoint.     Issue: Now if you go back to the XML view, the code for the endpoint is not there as ti should but the reference to the mule-jetty.xsd is still there and it shouldn't as there is no jetty element in the flow or in the global elements tab.     Be very careful when implementing this as the reference in the namespaces should be remve if there is no other instance of the element kind in a flow or as a global element such as a global endpoint or connector, but if there is no reference to an element kind (ex: some jetty element) there is no reason for the namespace to be there.

STUDIO-837,"Reference to the subflow get lost when changing the subflow name (Exception Strategy)","Steps to reproduce:   1.- Create a project in STUDIO with a flow and a sub-flow  2.- Go to the Flow properties window and set the Exception Subflow ref combo to the subflow that you have. Clic OK.   3.- Change the name of the subflow.  4.- Open the flow properties window, the subflow ref is blank    Expected behavior: the reference should be preserved no matters if the user decides to change the subflow name.

STUDIO-853,"Studio can be a lot smarter when handling logic expressions. I'd rather not see AND, OR, NOT filters in the palette","it seems we could have a single filter element in the flow control section that has one dialog that allows people to select an expression (this works for wildcard and regex) and have a section below to allow the user to add new filters with AND, OR or NOT.    I think this provides much better usability as there is now only a single filter element not a whole palette.  And it makes working with logic filters more natural for the user. i.e.it feels odd to have to start with an AND filter and then configure the expressions",34
STUDIO-1212,"Response section is not displayed","My config is as follows:  <flow name=""TicketFlowFlow1"" doc:name=""TicketFlowFlow1"">          <composite-source>              <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=""request-response"" host=""localhost"" port=""8081"" doc:name=""HTTP""/>              <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=""request-response"" path=""helloworld"" responseTimeout=""10000"" mimeType=""text/plain"" doc:name=""VM""/>          </composite-source>          <component class=""com.mulesoft.Component1"" doc:name=""Java""/>          <http:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=""request-response"" host=""localhost"" port=""8081"" doc:name=""HTTP""/>          <response>              <component class=""com.mulesoft.Component2"" doc:name=""Java""/>       	          </response>      </flow>    But the response is not displayed (see the pic attached)",5
STUDIO-1311,"Able to drag and drop composite source and poll as response elements","I am able to drag and drop composite source and poll as response elements of a flow. This is not correct: we should not let the user be able to drop composite source and poll there.     When dropping them as response elements an empty response box is created and in the XML configuration this is written:  <response/>    I am attaching a screen shot.",3
STUDIO-1333,"There is no specification when there is a global endpoint or a connector created in the global elements table, they are just called the same and it is confusing","This is a usability issue: There is no specification when there is a global endpoint or a connector created in the global elements table, they are just called the same and it is confusing.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Create an FTP global endpoint.  2. Create an FTP connector.  They have the same type and name in the global elements table (For the name there is already a Jira opened for that).     Type should specify if it is a global endpoint or a connector. Nowadays I think that type is useless, it doesn't say anything to the user. It just says ""FTP (EE)"" for global endpoint or connector. Same happens for the rest of the global endpoints and connectors and this is pretty confusing!!!",13

STUDIO-1676,"Suggest to stop the corresponding running mule instance when deleting a project","Steps to reproduce:  1 - Create a project  2 - Run it as a mule application  3 - Try to delete the project, including files.    An error dialog will pop up, related to mule still using the files and directories that are being deleted. To complete his desire to delete the project, the user will have to abort the operation (undo won't undo anything at all), stop mule, and try again.    Studio should prompt for the user's consent to stop the running mule instance if there is one running the applications of a project that is being deleted, so that the Delete operation does not fail, or otherwise gets cancelled.",5

STUDIO-1738,"Add JAXB support","It would be nice if you could support jaxb operations from GUI such as jaxb-xml-to-object-transformer jaxb-context etc.",2
STUDIO-1759,"More easily navigate between XML and GUI","It should be much easier to navigate from the GUI to the appropriate XML element or flow block within the XML. Furthermore, it would be great to go the other way as well, to click on an XML element and bring the user directly to a highlighted flow element within the GUI.",13
STUDIO-1811,"Studio is not validating that certain scopes should start only with inbound or outbound endpoints","(edit) This bug was first discovered for exception strategies. This is the description for that case:    When using the Message Flow tab, you can't drop inbound-only-endpoints into exception strategies (the UI forbids it). But you are able to do so through the XML, and there isn't any validation or indication that this is invalid.    Example:  {code:xml}<catch-exception-strategy>              <imap:inbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""143"" responseTimeout=""10000"" doc:name=""IMAP""/>          </catch-exception-strategy>{code}    This is invalid (IMAP is inbound, and only inbound), but there are no error markers whatsoever present. It should:  * be underlined in the XML  * present a problem in the Problems pane  * be drawn with the red-x in the Message Flow tab    This is also valid for any other kind of scope that has the restriction to start only with inbound or outbound endpoints. Some sample snippets that should fail, but dont:    {code:xml}<sub-flow name=""asdfFlow4"" doc:name=""asdfFlow4"">  		<imap:inbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""143""  			responseTimeout=""10000"" doc:name=""IMAP"" />  	</sub-flow>{code}    {code:xml}<composite-source>  			<smtp:outbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""25""  				responseTimeout=""10000"" doc:name=""SMTP"" />  		</composite-source>{code}    {code:xml}<poll frequency=""1000"">  			<imap:inbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""143""  				responseTimeout=""10000"" doc:name=""IMAP"" />  		</poll>{code}",5
STUDIO-2000,"Error unzipping MuleStudio in Windows in a long path","When unzipping MuleStudio in a long path (For example under Desktop or Document and Settings)  the errors shown in the attached screenshots may be shown.    The password protected error seems to be a Windows bug as explained in http://blogs.msdn.com/b/robcaron/archive/2006/09/14/755306.aspx    The problem is that this seems to be a Windows limitation and there is no much that can be changed in Studio to fix the issue (most of the failing files are eclipse classes)    The workaround is to install Studio in a simpler and shorter directory (For example C:\MuleStudio)    We need to add this in the release notes and see how to document it better for users.    Some other stuff to test:    # Does this happens with Winzip or Winrar (Or is only a problem of the default zip utility that comes with Windows)  # Once extracted in C:\MuleStudio, can the directory me moved to another location?  # Which specific versions of Windows present this issue?",21

The CloudHub hosted service should in turn make a call to a KissMetrics event of the same name as the example using the following URL:  http://trk.kissmetrics.com/e?_k=b276fa8e23213db7fba9868b5d3ba750344cdbb1&_p=123&_n=studiostartedevent  The CloudHub service then effectively acts as a proxy between Studio and the KissMetrics event.   In case that the CloudHub service is not available or that there is no connectivity to the CloudHub service from the machine on which the example is being executed, the URL call-out should fail gracefully with no noticeable effect from the Studio user's point of view.

I believe we need to come up with a strategy and common way of making comments, this could potentially be addressed by : http://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/STUDIO-2550    What I like about making notes in the xml is that I can view all the notes without having to click into components or hovering my mouse over them in the GUI.... I would probably use the description attribute to give detailed description of what the message processor does and then I would like to sometimes be able to put a 1/2 line brief description of what it does somewhere on the canvas. because doc:name attribute does not do text wrap and descriptions over a few words make the canvas look messy and forces message processors to spread out this is not a good way of labelling..

STUDIO-2655,"Lossing enpoint reference to a global endpoint across different flow files","How to re-crecreate:   (1) Create global endpoints (i.e. file:endpoint)in a dedicated flow file to store all global components.   (2) Then reference the global endpoints across from separate flow files.  (3) Complete the flow and test it to make sure it is working.   (4) Using the graphical editor(Message Flow tab) to edit the Display Name of each node.  At this point all the references will be removed, the flow will be broken.     The explanation:     We are trying to introduce the test driven development using the FunctionalTest.    For this, we need to put all the endpoints together with their connectors to a separate dedicated flow file. Then in the src/test/resources, we create a test flow file that contains the corresponding endpoints (with the same name) that will replace the real endpoints in the functional test.   However, the MuleStudio fail to recognise the global endpoints ferenced from across the separate flow file. Even worse, it keeps removing them while it is perfectlu legal in terms of mule.    Suggestion of fix:     option 1:    Able to recognise the global endpoints across different flow files    Option 2:   Just ignore the attributes and values it does not understand and put a warning sign instead of removing them. This may be preferable since MuleStudio may not understand all the added feature of the Mule components...   For example, MessagePropertiesTransformer has the scope attribute, this will be removed by the MuleStudio because it does not understand it.    Also it will be nice not to try to create mflow files for the files in src/test/resources, so that it will not complain about the uniqueue reference etc.... I know this should be another JIRA ticket :)                  ",5

STUDIO-3167,"Support hybrid metadata models","Right now DataSense supports two types of metadata:    * Static: Which is completely obtained from Instrospection of pojos  * Dynamic: Completely obtained from @MetadataRetriever method    Connectors such as Netsuite or ServiceSource present a hybrid case, in which most of the metadata is static, but the pojos that the connector handle have an internal map to represent custom fields. Right now there's no support OOTB for this and the case needs to be handled manually at the metadata retriever, forcing the user to instrospect the object by hand.    Also, if forces the connector to have two versions for each processor. For example, consider the following:    public MyPojo create(@Optional @Default(""#[payload]"") MyPojo pojo) { ... }    There's no way to make use of DataSense in that processor. Then, you're forced to add a second processor that looks like this:    public Map<String, Object> dynamicCreate(@MetadataKeyParam String type, @Optional @Default(""#[payload]) Map<String, Object>) { ... }    PROPOSAL    One solution that I can think of for this problem is to enable this hybrid cases by creating a new annotation called @MetadataDynamic or something like that. Then, the connector's pojos can annotate the map of dynamic fields with that annotation. Then, Studio/Devkit can scan for that annotation and automatically generate instrospection Medatata for that pojo, so that the metadata provider can only worry about custom types. This annotation should also be used to leverage DataSense in processors using such pojos so that we don't have to make dynamicXXX processors",13

Notice that the port is hardcoded to 8082  - Deploy the same app in Studio.  - Check the console and the terminal. Both logs show that the apps are deployed, without errors. Studio app should throw an exception saying that the port is already in use.  - Go to a new terminal, and run the command ""netstat -an | grep 8082"". You will see that the 8082 is listening, with tcp4 and tcp46. (See image1.jpg)  - If you make a request to http://localhost:8082, mule will answer that request, and studio will throw a Broken Pipe Exception.    This issue does not happen if you run the apps in the inverted order (First studio, Second Mule). In that case, Mule throws an exception saying that the port is already in use.    Scenario 2 (using ports of the other programs):  - Go to a terminal and run the command ""netstat -an""  - Look for an already taken port using tcp4 (for example in image2.jpg you can see that the ports 49298 and 63342 are not available)  - Deploy the attached app, changing the listener port to one of the previous ones.  - The app is deployed instead of saying that the port is already in use.

STUDIO-6845,"As a user I would like to have an option to customise the palette","As a user I would like to have an option to customise the palette so that I can choose what elements appear in it. This option should appear both as a preference page and as an accesible button in the palette view which will open the aforementioned preference page.    The preference page will allow to:    - Define new presets (A preset is a collection of categories and elements that are important to the user and that the user selects)  - Remove new presets  - Edit already created presets  - Select categories and elements that will be stored in the preset    When the user clicks ""Apply"" or ""Ok"" the palette must be updated with the elements of the selected preset.    Some considerations to take into account about presets:    - Presets will be stored as preferences as a workspace level.  - Each preset is associated to a runtime version. Then, a preset can be used in projects with the same runtime version.  - The preset preference page will not show presets that were created for a different runtime version than the current in-use project. For example, if a preset was created using a Mule project with 3.5 runtime, it will not be shown (in the preference page) when a user is working on a project that is using 3.7.  - The preference page must present at least a ""Default preset"" and a ""Weave Preset"". The first one will show all the elements (categories and message processors) that exist in the current runtime, that's the runtime that is being used by the current Mule project. The second one will show all the elements BUT NOT the transformers, instead the new Weave transformer must be shown. Both presets CAN'T be edited.    As a nice-to-have presets should be imported/exported in order to share them with others users.",8
