As an outcome of SERVER-25777, the mongo shell could already exit with a non-zero return code without printing a """"failed to load"""" message.    > The line that _is_ logged (""""a call to MongoRunner.stopMongod(), ReplSetTest#stopSet(), or ShardingTest#stop() may be missing from the test"""") also isn't/can't be logged at LogSeverity::Error, since it's not logged by a server process (and which makes the log line contain """" E """", which is another thing I typically look for when a test fails without """"failed to load"""").  >   > It took some confusion and additional scrolling through the logs for me to realize why my new test was reporting failure when it seemed like the test ran to completion successfully. Just a thought, in case there's something that can be done to make this failure easier to detect.    Esha Maharishi, I think your confusion is understandable. The goal of the message was to make it more obvious to the user what the remediation ought to be. Since that message isn't being surfaced clearly enough, we should change the logic in the mongo shell so that it is.    I don't see a reason that the mongo shell must use {{cout}} for logging the """"exiting with a failure due to unterminated processes"""" message, so we could replace it with a call to {{severe()}} instead (and prefix the log message with 'F'). Do you think that would be sufficient for your purposes? Would you mind filing a new SERVER ticket for this improvement request?    > For example, even just moving the """"a call to MongoRunner.stopMongod(), ReplSetTest#stopSet(), or ShardingTest#stop() may be missing from the test"""" just before/after the """"Summary: 1 test(s) ran in 35.86 seconds (0 succeeded, 0 were skipped, 1 failed, 0 errored)"""" could help.    Those messages are logged by two different processes (the mongo shell with the former and resmoke.py with the latter) so that isn't really something we'd consider. A related feature in resmoke.py would be to have special handling around certain exit codes from known processes. This case in the mongo shell would be one, but a memory leak detected by ASan/LSan would be another.  {quote}    See comment thread on SERVER-25640; one good idea from that thread is to make the mongo shell log an error message at a more severe log level.""","",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is variability in the order that {{getLastError}} returns from different workload clients, which may cause certain workload clients to always be stuck behind other clients that are doing more {{dropDatabase}} commands. When this happens, the client will receive another {{DatabaseDropPending}} error. But the client is [unable to distinguish|https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/17686781044525b9c3fbdf06ca326c8f4fb383ba/jstests/libs/override_methods/implicitly_retry_on_database_drop_pending.js#L141] whether the error is caused by the same dropDatabase command or a new one, causing the new wait to continue eat into the 10 minute timeout. There is a small probability that this cycle will happen for a handful of times in a row, which when combined with slow multi-minute {{dropDatabase}} commands, will exceed the 10 minute timeout.    *Solution*   The solution is to avoid retrying {{dropDatabase}} commands when it returns a {{DatabaseDropPending}} error. This will cause the workload to transition to a new state and continue to do so until the new state is no longer a {{dropDatabase}} call. Then it will wait on the ongoing {{dropDatabase}} call.    When the database is finally dropped, it's guaranteed that none of the clients waiting on it would be another drop database, so they should all be able to proceed. There might be edge cases where one client is able to execute multiple commands and one of those commands is another {{dropDatabase}}, but the likelihood of this happening 5 times in a row should be much smaller if not negligible.    From a correctness perspective, this change will make some {{dropDatabase}} implicitly into no-ops, which should not cause loss of test coverage, as databases can't be dropped in parallel in the first place.

Therefore, we must make a simple class that builds indexes via the IndexBuildsManager. There is no need for asynchronous threads on an embedded server, which is effectively a standalone without networking or asynchronously running threads.    I haven't looked into whether it is possible to just make a separate class to link into embedded, or inheritance is necessary, necessitating splitting the existing IndexBuildsCoordinator into and interface and implementation.

"SERVER-39723","02/21/2019 17:50:26",1,"Change listIndexes command behavior to show in-progress index builds ""The change in SERVER-25175 intended to fix a problem with initial sync as it interacts with its sync source to procure a list of indexes for each collection to build. If a background index build is in progress on the sync source and the sync source is a primary node, the background index build may or may not complete successfully. (Some examples of how it could fail are: 1. the node steps down 2. the background index build is interrupted by a killOp command 3. the background index build discovers some collection data that violates a constraint on the index being built, if the index spec has constraints.) The initial syncing node will proceed to attempt to build this same index, which might complete successfully even if the index build on the primary does not. This could leave the initial syncing node with an index that no other node has.    The initial sync process uses the listIndexes command on the sync source to obtain lists of indexes per collection. The attempt to fix this problem changed the listIndexes command to not report in-progress index builds (this will only affect background index builds, as foreground index builds lock the collection for their entirety and thus can never be observed in-progress by the listIndexes command). The fix had the intended effect for initial sync sync sources that are in primary state, but it also unintentionally changed the behavior of initial sync sync sources that are in secondary state. For such sources, background index builds are destined to complete successfully (since they already have done so on a primary node), and therefore cannot fail. Such index builds also write their oplog entries prior to completion, and therefore the only indication that an initial syncing node has to build the index is the listIndexes command response. Hiding in-progress index builds from initial sync for sync sources that are in secondary state could result in missing indexes for the initial sync. This code change restores the old behavior where listIndexes shows in-progress index builds.""","",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"SERVER-50282","05/19/2020 20:29:00",0,"Provide a debugging setup script for spawnhosts that load artifacts with coredumps ""Overlong filenames truncating important properties is actually a bug. This ticket has been repurposed to provide a script that unpackages files necessary for inspecting a coredump on a spawnhost. It assumes the bug will be eventually fixed (and the bug only impacts a subset of cases).    *Original Description*  The only time I spawn a host with data files from a test failure is when there's an available core dump that I want to load in GDB. I have a script that programmatically unpackages everything into the appropriate directory. Whether or not server engineers use a script to set up their gdb usage, I believe spawning a host to investigate a core dump is a common use-case.    Unfortunately when filenames are long, important properties [can be trimmed|https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/blob/86ebeb15ddc211f1390c5cc56af54a3712728e62/operations/fetch.go#L476] such as the keyword {{coredump}}\[1\]. What makes this difficult is that it not only breaks my script (acceptable, this sort of scripting isn't supported or built on some established agreement), but it also breaks my ability to do the corollary work by hand.     Doing a {{tar \-tf <archive>}} AFAIK is a complete filescan. At that point it's faster to just download the coredumps by hand. This arguably defeats the purpose of spawning a host with artifacts loaded.    I don't know what a feasible solution here is. There's probably a reason why filenames are long (for uniqueness? though IMO, unreadable). Some ideas:    * Use shorter strings for {{evergreen fetch}} to generate, which preserve the contents of the archive (at the expense of labeling the variant/task id which AFAIK only becomes a problem if a user fetches artifacts for multiple tasks in the same directory).   ** If this is backwords breaking for established use-cases, consider adding a flag to {{fetch}}, e.g: {{evergreen fetch -t <task> --artifacts --shortnames}}.
