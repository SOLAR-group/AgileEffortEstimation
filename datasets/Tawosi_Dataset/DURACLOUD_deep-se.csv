"DURACLOUD-8","01/04/2010 15:22:06","Properly implement getSpaceContentsChunked() in EMC storage provider","The EMC storage provider interface does not currently support paging the list of content items within a directory (in order to retrieve a partial list for each request) so the StorageProvider getSpaceContentsChunked() method does not function properly.

The request appears to fail to get metadata for the new file, so its link is removed and replaced with: Unable to complete request: status (200)  If you click on the link before it disappears, everything appears as it should, the metadata is displayed, and the file can be viewed or downloaded.  Note that this problem appears to occur when any of these characters show up in the contentID: +,"", #, %, &  So a couple of questions here: - What's causing the failure when retrieving metadata? - Why does the link to the item disappear when the metadata can't be retrieved?  As a side note, if you select a content item to view on the space page before the metadata for all content items has loaded, all content items in the list turn into error messages. The content page loads shortly after this, so things get back to normal, but it may appear to a user that they have done something wrong by clicking on a content link.",2

This means that when a file on the local file system, which has previously been added to DuraCloud, changes, it is not simply uploaded again.  There are a few choices that need to be made for this new feature to be added: 1. When a file already in DuraCloud changes on the file system, is the updated file transferred to DuraCloud or not. If so, the original file will likely need to be renamed to prevent collision. 2. How is the list of updated files communicated to the user. Are they printed to the console (stdout), or written to a file? Is this consistent between interactive mode and run-to-completion mode? 3. How does this feature impact the upload tool?  A comment from the State of North Carolina about how they envision this feature:  ""Our ideal upload tool would allow us to specify a local directory to update in the cloud, and the tool would then identify and upload new files (new files defined by file name and path), and alert us to any files that have changed (same file name and path but new checksum hash) and not upload the files that have changed (or upload them in a way that doesn't overwrite the files in the cloud).

I was thinking that this could be accomplished with an html/css/javascript app that is stored in one of the user's spaces, and allows them to select a space (if that's actually necessary, could be hard coded to the one that is their image library) and view a set of images. The javascript would need to make calls to the DuraCloud REST API to get the list of content items and display each one. The images would likely be scaled down a bit, to make browsing easier, and clicking on them would display the (slightly) larger size. The REST API would also be used to allow paging through the content items (and not trying to display too many at once). The option to specify a prefix for filtering would need to be there, and the user would need to be able to see the full content ID of the item they are viewing, since that will be the link back to the full size archival image on their internal system.

Unfortunately, this is not ideal for all use cases of the API.  For example, in the Replication Task Suite, we use ContentStoreImpl.getContentProperties() method as a way to tell whether content already exists in DuraCloud. If that content does not exist, we expect to receive a NotFoundException. This lets us perform logic like: ""If content exists in DuraCloud, see what checksum DuraCloud reports. If DuraCloud checksum differs from local checksum, re-upload the content.""  Unfortunately, however, getContentProperties() logs this same warning message to log4j 4 times in a row (1 + 3 retries) if the content does NOT yet exist in DuraCloud:  2014-07-14 16:46:28,336 WARN  org.duracloud.client.ContentStoreImpl @ Error attempting to get properties 'ITEM@10673-10.zip' in 'dspace-dev-backup' due to: Response code was 404, expected value was 200. Response body value: null  This causes the logs for the Replication Task Suite to actually fill up with unnecessary warnings from the DuraCloud v3.1.1 API. For example, anytime we want to upload NEW content to DuraCloud, we first check if it already exists (which logs that error x 4) before the new content is uploaded. The logged warnings would cause unnecessary worry for anyone looking at the logs -- in reality they are harmless in this scenario, as the content obviously doesn't exist before it is first uploaded.  It looks like the WARN message is generated by ""doGetContentProperties"" here: https://github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/storeclient/src/main/java/org/duracloud/client/ContentStoreImpl.java#L904  It is then repeated 4 times as a ""log.warn"" in the default execute() method (which is configured to do 3 retries): https://github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/storeclient/src/main/java/org/duracloud/client/ContentStoreImpl.java#L216  Ideally, there should be some way to configure the logging in the ContentStoreImpl. I like that this same task is retried 3 times. But in many scenarios, I'd rather it just throw me a final Error if all retries failed, rather than logging the same error message multiple times in a row.   If logging cannot be easily configurable, then switching the default execute() method to just do a ""log.debug"" would be better. That way I can see the underlying error if I turn on debugging, but by default my logs don't get filled with the same errors repeated.  NOTE: This was discovered while attempting to upgrade the DSpace Replication Task Suite to use DuraCloud API version 3.1.1 (JARS: storeclient, storeprovider, common).

"DURACLOUD-942","09/17/2015 15:50:00","Add support for S3 - Infrequently Accessed storage option","According to this announcement: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-storage-update-new-lower-cost-s3-storage-option-glacier-price-reduction/?sc_ichannel=em&sc_icountry=global&sc_icampaigntype=launch&sc_icampaign=em_148542750&sc_idetail=em_2049897831&ref_=pe_430550_148542750_7, Amazon is now offering the option of a lower cost S3 tier for infrequently accessed data. This task is to transition all DuraCloud content to this new option.    The best way to take advantage of S3 - IA is via bucket lifecycle policies. Because of the additional cost of content deletes in the first 30 days, it would be best to set these policies to transition content from S3 Standard storage to S3 - IA storage after the content has been stored for 30 days. This policy should be created when a new space is created (via the S3StorageProvider)    As part of this work, the current S3 task which transitions content to Reduced Redundancy storage should be replaced with a task that adds the bucket policy for S3 - IA to an existing bucket. To complete this transition, a script will need to be written which uses this task to update all current accounts.    The storage class init parameter should also be removed (from both app-config, and from the MC). It no longer makes sense to support reduced redundancy storage.",2

The back up thread period should not be tied to the polling period.  Instead it should run at least every 5 minutes by default.  Also thread synchronization on on the ChangedList.persist method is causing threads to wait until the backup file is completely written rather than waiting only until the file list is copied in memory.",1

However we are also using the field for jpa versioning.   JPA as a result is overwriting the values we are setting programmatically just before persisting the data causing the event to appear to have occurred later in time than it actually occurred.   The result is that the manifest can fall out of sync with the storage provider in a couple of ways when deletes and updates occur within relatively narrow timeframes and there is high latency in the audit message processing times:  1) a manifest record may appear to be missing.  2) the checksum on the manifest may be out of sync with the file.",3

"DURACLOUD-1133","08/01/2017 00:07:38","Reintroduce exclusions into DirWalk for the sake of efficiency","Currently (as of 4.3.6) the DirWalker does not exclude directories directly.  Rather it looks at files only and then traverses the ancestors of the file in search of matching directories to exclude.  Thus the DirWalker will unnecessarily slow to a crawl when traversing an excluded directory with large numbers of files.  With the recent commit to resolve duracloud-1129 the exclusion check was moved from DirWalker to ChangedList.  However,  without exclusion checks in the DirWalker,  all files within an excluded directory will still be traversed thus slowing the DirWalker.  It should be noted that on reintroduction,  it is necessary to add logic that was previously missing (ie in 4.3.6) to ensure that directories are filtered directly.",2
