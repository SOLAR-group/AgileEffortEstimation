To fix:    * Confirm desired behaviour is what we want  * Need to make sure we have good automated test cases for these selection and copy-paste scenarios  * Fix the underlying issues    [Copy and paste of original comments|http://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=278070932]    h3. History from CAC    *Shannon GreyWalker*    """"EPIC"""" BUG    The conversation thread that culminated in this specific comment up above has shed light on what I think is a """"super pattern"""" that collectively describes various specific bugs that users have been reporting with the cut/copy/paste/dragMove behavior of the 4.x editor. The most concise way to describe this """"epic"""" bug is as follows:    *4.x editor does not consistently preserve and reproduce the semantic/visual structure (order and nesting) of a diverse set of selected elements when cutting/copying > pasting, or when drag-moving, into a new location*    Note that I'm stressing the semantic and visual structure of the selection, because the new editor makes it truly impossible to understand how the start and end points of the selection correspond to the specific start and end tags of the underlying selection in the XML storage format of the page. Therefore, all your users can rely on is what they see in the rendered/styled text within the editor. And what they see is always clearly representative of a semantic structure that has a specific order and nesting of semantic elements.    I would very much like to see a single JIRA issue number assigned to this overarching """"epic"""" bug so that I can track a single JIRA ticket instead of multiple more granular JIRA tickets. Why? Because IMO this is one more """"showstopper"""" issue that will prevent my company from migrating from 3.5.x to 4.x. Now that I've been banging specifically on copy/cut/paste/dragMove mechanics and seeing how truly dysfunctional the overall behavior currently is even in 4.1.5, I cannot give a green light internally to migration until the meta-issue I describe above is fully resolved in the most typical use cases. Now that I understand that these problems are essentially all bugs and not """"behavior as designed, which can be managed correctly through some common conceptual workarounds"""", I cannot force this confusing behavior on my user base.    It's worth noting that in the old wiki syntax, what you select is always 100% obvious, and is exactly what you paste, and the resulting behavior is always 100% predictable. So this is an entirely new problem introduced with the 4.x environment. Remember, moving things around in and between pages is at least 50% or more of what your heads-down users spend their time doing in the editor. Writing is mostly revision.    I strongly recommend that once you get this """"epic"""" bug resolved, you create several functional tests based on several test pages that you always faithfully run during regression for every single point release of Confluence, and you do not release if any of those functional tests fail. Why, again because cut/copy/paste/dragMove is at least 50% of what your users spend every hour in Confluence actually doing. Your code for cut/copy/paste/dragMove needs to be 100% reliable and predictable based upon what your users can actually see and infer in the rendered WYSIsortaWYG text in the editor. It was 100% reliable before in wiki syntax mode, so it needs to be the same in 4.x or we have a net loss and lots of confused and pissed-off users.    Here are two specific and common functional tests I can think of off the top of my head. Both of these also serve to illustrate the meta pattern I describe above for this """"epic"""" bug:    h5.Functional Test 1 - Cut and paste within an ordered list     h6. Test object         h6. Sub Test 1.1 - Select from start of semantic parent, paste before start of another semantic parent       # Select from the first character of the text within parent Step 3 through:  ## The last character of the text within child Step 3.b.  ## The last character of the text within child Step 3.b, and then press Shift + rightArrow one time to extend the selection highlight to the right margin of the editor frame.  ## Also select the entire scope of Step 3 > 3.a > 3.b by placing the selection point immediately before the first character of the text within parent Step 3, then using Shift + downArrow three times to extend the selection highlight to the right margin of the editor frame for Step 3.b.  ## The middle of the text within child Step 3.b (end just before the word """"originally"""").  # Cut the selection.  # Place the selection point immediately before the first character of the text within Step 2.  # Paste the cut selection.

Sub Tests    Okay I'm not going to make another long vertical wall of specific tests and expected results here, because hopefully you see how the same testing pattern enumerated for the ordered list test object would be applied to this new test object comprising a semantic mixed content model for common combinations of paragraph and list block elements plus some nested macro objects (each of which contains a mixture of typical paragraph and list block elements.    The basic idea is to apply the same four tests here to this new test object, ideally within *Section 2* because it contains the most complex mixture of semantic objects.    * Sub Test 2.1 - Select from start of one semantic parent, paste before start of another semantic parent. For example, what would you intuitively expect to happen if you selected the entire panel macro in *Section 2* and then pasted the selection with your insertion point immediately before the first character of the first bullet in the bullet list of *Section 1*. Yeah, you see where I'm going here, right? Do you get this intuitively expected result right now? Nope.  * Sub Test 2.2 - Select from start of one semantic parent, paste in middle of another semantic parent. I won't bore you with examples. I hope you get it by now.  * Sub Test 2.3 - Select from middle of one semantic parent, paste before start of another semantic parent. Yada yada.  * Sub Test 2.4 - Select from middle of one semantic parent, paste in middle of another semantic parent. Yada yada.    *The bottom line with all these functional test objects and the four typical semantic cut/copy/paste/dragMove sub tests to perform on each one boils down to one intuitively expected UX pattern:*    * Structurally speaking, the clipped/pasted result of a selection should be the exact same whether the selection's end-point is at the end of a visible text line in the editor or the end-point is at the right margin. Yes, under the covers this subtle distinction makes for a different range in the tinyMCE's information it gets from the browser, but for a user looking at the screen, there is no distinction; it's the same exact thing. Your code should reflect this user perception and should not reflect the actual technical distinction under the covers in the DOM.    * The complete visual and semantic structure of the clipped selection should be preserved and reproduced exactly the same in the new, pasted context, AND    * The visual and semantic structure into which you pasted the clipped selection should """"split"""" around the inserted paste and that split structure should be maintained with the same exact structure in both halves of the split.    * When you have to make a decision between acting upon what's really selected (or where the insertion point is) based on the underlying DOM of the selection range reported by the browser versus what the user sees visually in the editor and thinks of as being """"the semantic objects I've selected"""", you should always decide in favor of what the user visually and conceptually sees with their own eyes.    * Good luck with this. I'm sure it can be done. The question is: how soon? And what JIRA issue number do I track to watch for completion of this?    ----    *Paul Curren*    Hi Shannon. I apologise for the delay in responding to this comment. I've been in contact with our bug-fixing team to go through the issues you have described here. We will get one or more issues raised soon, as appropriate and let you know the numbers for tracking purposes.    Thanks.    ----    *Shannon Greywalker*    Thanks Paul. I know it was a lot to chew on and spec out. No worries; thanks for the update.  ""","      1. This is originally step 1         a. This is originally step 1.a         b.

Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-30116].   {panel}  In earlier versions, the JIRA issue macro had a pagination feature. This feature was removed due to observed low feature usage, in addition with our strategic focus to simplify the Confluence user interface and to keep and complex JIRA operations in JIRA. My apologies for the may customers that were quickly impacted by this, we could have done a better job in communicating this and ensuring we had understood your needs with regards to this matter.     Since then we've received a lot of feedback to bring back pagination. Thank you for those of you who provided helpful comments below, and for those customers we have been able to speak to about this. With this in mind, we have concluded the following:    * It is very clear that the current issue limit we have is insufficient and does not meet most of your needs.   * It is important for you to be able to see _all_ the issues requested   * We still believe that the use case of navigating 100+ issues within inside Confluence is something that is extremely low and is something which should be done in JIRA.   * Some of you mentioned of the importance of seeing this also in PDF exports when you share the release notes or pages with customers.     With that in mind, what will we be doing to address this?  1. We will look at increasing the limit of the total number of visible issues  2. In addition, we will look at providing a parameter to configure this.  *Note:* You will always be limited by the total amount of issues JIRA provides, but [this setting can be changed|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ONDEMANDKB/Changing+maxResults+Parameter+for+JIRA+REST+API].  3. We will be looking at also implementing CONF-30114 (sorting) to assist with dealing with larger issue lists in Confluence.     Thank you all for your patience in this matter, we will update this issue as we make progress.     Sherif Mansour  Confluence Product Manager    Previous description:   {panel}  The new JIRA issues macro does not paginate. This feature request is to help us better understand why customers want this.   If you are going to comment on this ticket, please provide some understanding for why you want pagination. We removed this feature because we saw very low usage of it. Since then, we've had a few requests to bring it back.     One way we could solve the majority use case is to increase the default amount of search results displayed. We are a bit hesitant to bring this back as we want to understand what it is that we are missing. If you are embedding 50/100+ issues on a page and want pagination, you probably shouldn't be doing that in Confluence, but rather the JIRA issue navigator - that is why we tell you """"there are xxx more issues, open in JIRA"""".     Please help us understand why you want this and some examples where you really do have lots of issues on a page that you want your end-users to read (if that is the use case)  {panel} ""","",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The correct behaviour should be to call JIRA asynchronously and timeout the individual macros, not the page.    The number of calls that JIRA can handle should also be considered. We should avoid overloading JIRA.    h3. Workaround:    Split out the JIRA Issues Macro onto separate pages.    Also avoid using functionality that avoids loading multiple pages at once, such as viewing the blogs posts of a space, as this will trigger many calls to JIRA simultaneously.    h3. Fix  Upgrade to [JIRA Macros version 5.5.4|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/confluence.extra.jira]. This was bundled in Confluence 5.5.    h3.

This is certainly an issue which has done its round on the internet over the years for many browser and application vendors alike, with each pointing the finger at each other as to whether the application or browser should observe the EXIF rotation metadata.    The obvious solution is for all browsers to support the 'image-orientation' CSS, however after many years this is still only supported by Firefox.  We have explored no less than 6 different solutions to this issue as each brings pros and cons in terms of performance, behaviour and complexity.  As a result of this exercise, it has been decided that image rotation would be done server side based on the EXIF rotation metadata.    The actual implementation is somewhat different for Server and Cloud deployments, and thus the rollout/delivery may occur at different times, however is high up in the queue right now.

The results will return, but attempting to click the """"Insert"""" button won't do anything. Checking the JavaScript console in the browser should show the error above.     h4. Additional information:  After some debugging we narrowed it down to the fact that Confluence doesn't appear to escape some field names that can be misinterpreted as array method names. In this case, the Jira custom field was called *Length* and appears to be misinterpreted as a call to the {{array.length()}} method of a given array r[]    This didn't happen with Confluence 5.1.5, so the bug was introduced since then.    h4.

Summary  Trying to add JIRA Charts in Confluence page will render the chart properly in the screens before inserting it to the page, but clicking on _Insert_ will get the chart disssapear and the Confluence page is unable to be saved. Seems like Confluence renders JIRA Charts data using both Application URL and Display URL.    h4. Steps to reproduce  (*execute the test from machine1*)  # Set up JIRA on machine1 (sample IP: 10.60.5.193) and Confluence on machine2 (sample IP: 10.60.5.198)  # (Test scenario) Current Base URL of JIRA is *http://10.60.5.193:8630/jira* and Confluence is *http://10.60.5.198:10561/confluence*  # Set up /etc/hosts on machine1 with _127.0.0.1 jiraisawesome_  # Login to *http://10.60.5.193:8630/jira* from *machine1*  # Set up application link using IP and ports (e.g: connect to *http://10.60.5.198:10561/confluence*)  # Login to *http://10.60.5.198:10561/confluence* from *machine1*  # Create a new Confluence Page  # Insert JIRA Chart by searching any existing JIRA project and Save the page (_Chart is displayed successfully_)  # Login to *http://10.60.5.193:8630/jira* from *machine1*  # Change the base URL of JIRA to use *http://jiraisawesome:8630/jira*  # Login to *http://10.60.5.198:10561/confluence* from *machine1*  # Modify the application link of JIRA - Display URL in Confluence to use *http://jiraisawesome:8630/jira*  # Perform Step 7 and 8 again    Here are the results  * We can view the chart in the preview of the prompt, but when _insert_ the chart, its not showing in the page preview and unable to click on the save button.  * URLs of the problem can be seen in the browser's developer mode  {code}HTTP 200 http://jiraisawesome:8624/jira/charts?filename=jfreechart-onetime-2627007503907999135.png    HTTP 504 http://10.60.2.176:8553/553/plugins/servlet/image-generator?macro=jirachart&jql=project+%3D+DEMO&statType=assignees&appId=29d6aed3-a496-3929-a14b-c4653473b6b3&chartType=pie&authenticated=true{code}    h4. Logs information  * Confluence log    * JIRA logs      h4. Additional Information  JIRA 6.2.7  Confluence 5.5.3    h4. Use case  There are users who configures JIRA and Confluence integration to be using a different Application URL than the Display URL. This configuration is used when the two servers not able to be contacted between each other using the Display URL.

As we dug deeper into the IE11 memory leak issue, we have been able to reliably reproduce the leak within IE11 11.0.9600.18861 (circa 08/2017) on Windows 8. Using a vanilla Confluence installation and refreshing the page a number of time, it can be observed that the memory consumed by the page itself remains consistent, however the iexplore.exe process continues to grow.    Restesting on IE11 11.251.16299.0 (circa 02/2018) and Edge 41.16299.248.0 on Windows 10 we were unable to reproduce the same memory leak.    We have not been able to find a definitive list of the issues fixed in this IE11 release, but believe the issue is [Memory leak - IE Edge - Microsoft Edge 8020622|https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/8020622/] (previosuly fixed in Edge only). Therefore, whilst we are confident that this issue can be resolved, there is a small chance that there still remains an issue.    *Resolution:* Please upgrade to Windows 8/10 and the latest version of IE11 (11.251.16299.0) circa 02/2018 and Edge 41.16299.248.0 or greater to fix this issue. NOTE: The issue persists on Windows 7 for which we have not plans to address this as we believe the issues lies with Microsoft.

"CONFSERVER-38993","09/01/2015 18:24:56",3,"XML Exports containing special characters (like an Ellipsis) in Highlighted Inline Comments Increases String Length, causing the XML Import to Fail  ""{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}    *NOTE:* This bug report is for *Confluence Server*. Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-38993].    {panel}    h3. Summary  Whenever a user inserts an ellipsis character (i.e. """"…"""" which is three dots represented as a single character) as content in Confluence, and an inline comment is created from highlighting that content, the resulting Site Export (or Space Export containing comments) will convert the ellipsis to three separate period characters (i.e. 3 """"."""" in a row). Thus, the resulting string in the entities.xml import will be longer in character count than the original string. If the original string was close to 255 characters, the 'converted' string will be greater than 255 characters. This causes subsequent attempts to import this data to fail with the following error:    {code} ERROR [Long running task: Importing data] [sf.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter] logExceptions Data truncation: Data too long for column 'STRINGVAL' at row 1{code}    or this one:    {code}Caused by: java.sql.BatchUpdateException: Batch entry 2 insert into CONTENTPROPERTIES (PROPERTYNAME, STRINGVAL, LONGVAL, DATEVAL, PROPERTYID) values ('inline-original-selection', 'typedef struct EthrLagGroupCbkEntryData{    EthrLagGroupLagLinkList ethrLagLinkList; /* List of LAG links */    EthrLagMemberSpeed ethrLagMemberSpeed;    EthrManualMacAddress ethrManualMacAddress;    ......

Steps to Reproduce  # Log in to Confluence and create a new page  # Enter the following as text in the page   # highlight the content and wait for the inline comment icon to appear  # create an inline comment  # notice the string length for the highlighted text is less than 255 characters  # Perform a space export, selecting custom to include comments  # Once the zip is created, open the entities.xml and search for the inline comment  # Notice the new content is more than 255 characters   # This breaks the Space Import since the data column size for STRINGVAL is 255.      h3. Expected Results  The export does not add characters to special characters like the ellipsis.    h3. Notes  For the error to be replicated in an import, the original string for the highlighted text has to be close to 255 characters. If the string is not close, the conversion will not affect the import as it will remain under 255.    h3.Workaround  Before exporting, delete the inline comments which are highlighting text which are close to 255 characters and contain the ellipsis character. Alternatively, you can edit the entities.xml file and shorten the inline comment there to be less than 255 characters."""," ERROR [Long running task: Importing data] [sf.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter] logExceptions Data truncation: Data too long for column 'STRINGVAL' at row 1Caused by: java.sql.BatchUpdateException: Batch entry 2 insert into CONTENTPROPERTIES (PROPERTYNAME, STRINGVAL, LONGVAL, DATEVAL, PROPERTYID) values ('inline-original-selection', 'typedef struct EthrLagGroupCbkEntryData{    EthrLagGroupLagLinkList ethrLagLinkList; /* List of LAG links */    EthrLagMemberSpeed ethrLagMemberSpeed;    EthrManualMacAddress ethrManualMacAddress;    ......

"CONFSERVER-48771","11/17/2015 04:45:44",3,"JIRA options can be very slow to return with a high number of Roles and/or Shared Filters ""When adding JIRA content to Team Calendars, Confluence will reach out to JIRA to obtain options that are returned by the following JIRA URL: http://<jira_base_url>/rest/ical/1.0/ical/config/query/options    This options query times out after 10 seconds by default. Administrators can extend this timeout by following [this KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/JIRA+Calendar+Read+Timed+Out].    Through SQL logging in JIRA, we find that the following components appear to impact the query return time greatly:  * For every project, JIRA appears to fire off one SQL query for each role that exists. In other words, the cost is _number of roles_ times _number of projects_.  * JIRA fires off one SQL query for each shared filter (i.e. excluding private filters).    In one observed instance, there were:  * 1000 projects, 3 roles =  3000 SQL queries  * 15000 shared filters = 15000 SQL queries    Each query took 1-3ms including DB connection borrow and return. Adding latency and other overhead, http://<jira_base_url>/rest/ical/1.0/ical/config/query/options on this instance took 56000ms to finish, well over the 10000ms default timeout.

Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-40154].   {panel}  h3. Summary  A page with the """"Content by label"""" macro, combined with an Excerpt Display of """"Rich content"""", will render itself leading to a stack overflow.    *This causes:*  * high CPU usage with more than 10MB of log every second.  * Confluence becomes unresponsive until the overflow finishes.  * Going to the page can also return an Error page when the page is displayed.  * The page may render with infinite traces of itself.  * In Cloud the page will automatically try to refresh every 2 minutes if window is left open and will trigger the problem again.    h3. Environment  * Confluence 6.0 or 5.9  * Content by Label macro    h3. Steps to Reproduce  # Create a new page  # Add a """"Content by label"""" macro, configured as:  #* Label: """"testing""""  #* Excerpt Display: """"rich content""""  # Save the page  # Add a label to the page: """"testing""""  # Refresh the page (May require 2 or 3 refreshes for the label to be updated)    h3.

This username hash is stored in the table user_mapping which is made of three columns (user_key, username, lower_username). The last column has a unique index.    Now in cwd_user, there is no index on column lower_user_name. The only index there is on lower_user_name is composed with the other column directory_id.    So this means that for every action where Confluence looks up for creator information, it makes a full table scan on cwd_user. (Unless the caching in Confluence helps to avoid this ? )    h3.

Workaround   - Install the [Confluence Server|https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/confluence-server/id1288365159?mt=8] iOS app and use that instead - requires Confluence 6.8 or later   - Or install Google Chrome or Firefox instead on the device and use that.   - Or disable Confluence Mobile by disabling the system add-on called the 'Confluence Mobile Plugin' .

"CONFSERVER-45189","11/08/2016 22:40:26",8,"External gadgets in Confluence should not prompt users to Login and Approve ""Problem:    When using an external gadget (e.g., JIRA gadget """"Pie Chart"""") in a Confluence page, every user who views the page is prompted to """"Login and approve"""" the gadget in JIRA before they can see the content.    This happens *for every user for every gadget,* meaning that if I create a Confluence page using Pie Chart, Filter Results, Average Age Chart, and Two-Dimensional Issue Statistics and send it to executives for review, every executive has to """"Login and Approve"""" every gadget. Worse, sometimes the """"approval"""" token doesn't stick, and a user has to go through the process again.    We have tried single sign-on, creating a trusted application link, setting up 2-way oauth with impersonation, and combinations of all of the above, to no avail.    Atlassian support has confirmed there is currently no way to bypass or automate the approval.    This is unacceptable for our 10,000 user base and makes our Confluence look unprofessional.    *Please allow 2-way oauth with impersonation to automatically approve external gadgets.*    Note: We never experienced this problem on Confluence 5.6. We cannot roll-back our upgrade, but we are severely regretting it.    h3. Steps to Reproduce:  # Integrate JIRA with Confluence through Application link.  # On the create application link wizard, check the same user base option and make sure the user used for the integration is exist on Confluence.  # After it, an applicaiton link with Oauth(Impersonation) will be created.  # On JIRA Dashboard, add a new gadget to find JIRA Gadget XML e.g. Filter Result Gadget.  # Copy the XML link and navigate to Confluence _General Configuration > External Gadgets_.  # Add the gadget by using the XML link.  # Create a new Confluence page and add a gadget by using """"Other Macros""""  # Choose the newly added JIRA """"Filter Results"""" gadget.    h3. Expected Result:  - Just like JIRA Issue Macro, the filter will be researchable or issues for JIRA Issue Macro.    h3. Actual Result:  - """"Login & Approve"""" will come out and user need to authenticate to retrive filters in JIRA.    h3. Note:  Referring to the documentation [Oauth Security for Applinks|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/APPLINKS/OAuth+security+for+application+links] that using impersonation would not be needed for the user to authenticate as long the user is not redirected to the linked information:  bq. they're automatically authenticated on the other application and don't get asked to authorize requests.

"CONFSERVER-45921","01/26/2017 15:30:37",3,"Blog post titles for different dates within the same space must be unique if Collaborative Editing is enabled ""h3. Summary  If you enable Collaborative Editing in Confluence 6.x and create two blog posts with identical titles in the same space (whether they're created on the same day or not), Confluence throws an error message saying:  {quote}A page with the title 'blog 1' already exists in this space. Enter a different title for your page.{quote}    In short, this means the behaviour with Collaborative Editing turned on is as such:  # Two blog posts with identical titles set for the same day cannot be saved.  # Two blog posts with identical titles set for different days cannot be saved.    The behaviour is different with Collaborative Editing turned off / in Confluence 5.x, whereby the results are as such:  # Two blog posts with identical titles set for the same day cannot be saved.  # Two blog posts with identical titles set for different days *can* be saved.    This change is not mentioned anywhere in the [Confluence 6.0 Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-6-0-release-notes-844235309.html].    h3.

Expected Results  The second blog post can be saved.    h3. Actual Results  The second blog post can't be saved with the following error:     !Screen Shot 2017-01-26 at 9.57.15 PM.png|thumbnail!

"CONFSERVER-45966","01/29/2017 13:07:25",2,"Links containing umlaut or cyrillic characters become invalid ""h3. Summary    When you insert a link that contains umlaut or cyrillic characters via {{Insert more content > Link > Web link}} or the shortcuts {{⌘+K}} / {{CTRL+K}}, the link changes so that Confluence encodes the percentage (%) symbol as {{%25}}. This renders the link to be unusable.    For example:   # Correct link inserted into a Confluence page: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6wen]   # Incorrect link after saving the page and clicking on the link: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%25C3%25B6wen]    You can see the % symbol in the original link has been replaced as {{%25}}.  h3. Steps to Reproduce    Option 1   # Create a new page and insert a web link via one of the methods below:   ** {{Insert more content > Link > Web link}}   ** {{⌘+K}} / {{CTRL+K}}   # Insert this URL into the 'Address' field: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6wen]   # Insert any text into the the 'Link text' field.   # Click on """"Insert"""".   # Save the page.   # Try to open the link.    Option 2   # Create a new page and paste a web link   # Edit the link and see that the 'Address' and 'Link text' field have not changed   # Change the 'Link text' field to new text   # Save the link   # Edit the link again   # The URL in the 'Address' field has now been changed    h3. Expected Results    The link on the page should direct you to the correct page: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6wen]  h3. Actual Results    The link directs you to an invalid page: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%25C3%25B6wen]  h3. Notes    Tested in Confluence 5.9.14. The functionality works as expected  h3. Workaround    -Option 1: Replace all {{%}} signs in links with spaces instead-   # -Take: {{[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6wen]}} URL-   # -Change to: {{[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L] C3 B6wen}}-    Option 1: Paste the link into the editor instead of using insert link dialog.   * In this method you cannot modify the link text, so the link text will be automatically set based on the url    Option 2: Use square brackets to insert the link. [ ]   # Type """"[""""   # Type the text you want for your link in the editor, for example """"My Link""""   # Type a """"|""""   # *Type* the url   # Type """"]"""" to complete the link.   # Save or preview the page to confirm it works.   # *Important!* Don't open the link dialog for this link. If you do, the link will be double-encoded.    For step 4, you could also try pasting the url but this might have less success since the url will be converted to a link automatically and you might have to first undo that automatic conversion, which in turn may cause the closing """"]"""" to have no effect. See option 3 instead.    Option 3   # Paste the URL into the editor.   # Press undo to undo any automatic link creation/extraction so you see the original URL.   # If the URL is still a link, click it, and click """"Unlink"""" to return it back to regular text.   # At the beginning of the link, type [ followed by `Escape` to exit the Link Autocomplete   # Type the text to display for the link followed by """"|""""   # Now your link should look like this   ## !Screen Shot 2017-05-11 at 7.37.39 AM.png|width=379,height=48!   # Click at the end of the link and type """"]"""" to complete the link. This should auto-convert it to a link with the desired text.   # Save or preview the page to confirm it works.   # *Important!* Don't open the link dialog for this link.

[11:51 AM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: Because it all feels like we're looking in the wrong place  [11:54 AM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: hmmmmm, maybe not  [11:54 AM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: any time DefaultResourceDataHandler.createAttachmentDataHandler is called, it reads all the bytes in the relevant attachment  [11:55 AM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: and that *could* be being called on rest requests, even when that DataHandler is subsequently not used for anything  [11:56 AM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: that's all as a side effect of invoking com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.calendarstore.event.transformers.SubCalendarEventSupportingInviteesTransformer#transform  [11:59 AM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: It looks like that Transformer will only trigger the problem if there is precisely one invitee for the event that's being sent. If there are more, then we'll just append the names of the invitees (sounds like bad ux)  [11:59 AM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: Looks like you're getting 30 requests for the same file because you're retrieving 30 events with the same user  [12:00 PM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: You'll be happy to know that switching to Aa managed avatars will probably make this problem go away for you  [12:02 PM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: of course, it will also *break* in that case, because it assumes that all profile pictures are still managed by Confluence's AttachmentManager  [12:11 PM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: @DuyLuong which issue tracker should @Edu  raise a bug in?  [12:12 PM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: Looks like we can fix an ugly performance and memory problem at the same time, simply by making the Transformer (or DataHandler) aware that it's rendering for REST vs a notification  [12:13 PM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: (notification ==> inline any Avatar that isn't external)  [12:13 PM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: And at the same time, we can fix the bug where external avatars will cause NPEs or worse  [12:14 PM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: Just because a ProfilePictureInfo has a downloadPath, it doesn't mean that path is inside Confluence  [12:15 PM] Richard Atkins [Atlassian]: I'm assuming that there's another team taking care of the Cloud side of the TeamCal fork...  {quote}    ""","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"CONFSERVER-51951","03/22/2017 09:49:31",8,"Indexer does not handle attachments efficiently for a page update ""h3. Summary  There are two *different* symptoms for this problem, but both go back to the same root cause.    h5. Scenario 1  When a page is updated and needs to be indexed, the indexer does not add the attachments, comments and permissions into the journal table. This will overload the hibernate session, where it will pick up items from the journal table. These items will introduce more work on the indexer than expected, where it will need to process all the attachments, comments and permissions of the current page. From the user perspective, it will look like the indexer stalls and slow at processing a small number of tasks     h5. Scenario 2  When a page is updated multiple times and those changes are included in a single indexer batch, the indexer does not handle this efficiently. It will index those changes with every change.      h3. Steps to Reproduce  Reproducing this behavior for Scenario 2 will require multiple quick updates to a certain page (within 5 seconds.)    *Hint:* This can be done through rest api   # Create a new page   # Add multiple attachments to the page (preferably large attachments)   # Edit the page and save   # Edit the page again and save   # Edit the page a third time and save   # Enable DEBUG logging for the package        h3. Expected Results  The indexer will show that it is processing the page along with all the attachments, comments and permission efficiently.   The page should be processed *only once* in a single batch.        h3. Actual Results  The indexer will show that it is processing a single page only while it is actually processing page, attachments, comment and permissions. Also the indexer will process each change separately, redoing all the work again.  This is very time and resource consuming and will cause the indexer to stall or lead to an outage      Large attachments can affect the processing time as well.

Summary    Per Developer Escalation creating this defect for a problem that occurs when a Page Properties report on a grandchild Page contains an embedded JIRA macro. The ultimate parent page will be thrown into a continuously refreshing loop, and we are unable to stop the loop from occurring without forcing the browser to stop.  h4. Steps to Reproduce   # Create a new Confluence 6.0.6 instance   # Add the demo site content and a local admin account   # Import the attached Space Export [^se2.zip] into the newly created Confluence 6.0.6 site   # Perform a Content Indexing administration for the site   # Navigate to <yourConfleunceURL>/display/TS2/Page+Properties+testing   # Observe the page in a *continuous loop* as the Page Properties report in a grandchild page has a JIRA issues gadget in the report   # Observe that you can not stop the page from looping by clicking links, the back button or other methods   # Quit your browser   # Reopen your browser   # Go to <yourConfluenceURL>/display/TS2/Summary+of+BLUE+Child+Pages   # Remove the JIRA Gadget in the report for *Blue page 1, with JIRA Gadget*   # Navigate back to <yourConfleunceURL>/display/TS2/Page+Properties+testing   # Observe that the page looping is no longer present    h4. Expected Results    Page Properties reports would display without issue and the page would render normally.  h4. Actual Results    Page becomes stuck in a loop, and continues to attempt to render the reports - refreshing the page continuously and appending to the page URL with each attempt. The only way to stop the rendering is to force the browser to stop the attempt by manual intervention.   h4. Workaround    The only workaround at present is to insure that JIRA macros are only embedded at the Child Page level and *no* *deeper* than the child level, or the looping will occur. ""","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, if there are any existing link corruptions that occurred prior to upgrading to 6.8.0, those corruptions will remain, and the only way to fix is to either revert to a published version of a page without such corruptions, or discard the draft (if the corruption is only in the draft).

Workaround  h5. Turn Collaborative Editing Off and back On (recommended)    It has been confirmed that *turning Synchrony Off and On* again resolves the related issue with links in --CONFSERVER-52455--. It is unclear if this applies to the image issue as well.    !https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png|width=16,height=16!   All existing shared drafts are lost when you switch collaborative editing off, so make sure your users have published any work they want to keep before you make the change.   # Go to  !https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/files/590259974/590058056/1/1398739558493/Cog.png! > *General Configuration* > *Collaborative editing*   # Click *Change mode*   # Select *Off*   # Click *Change*   # Then turn Synchrony back on   # Then [rebuild the index|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/content-index-administration-148844.html#ContentIndexAdministration-Rebuildingthesearchindex] via the UI   # The issue will stop occurring but you will need to go back and manually restore any pages that were affected  ## You can restore the page to an older version  ## Or you can manually adjust the links    h5. Note about this workaround  When Collaborative Editing is enabled, and a page is being edited, all those small changes are stored in Synchrony in-memory cache/events table on the database. That includes the base URL.   When the base URL got changed in Confluence, Synchrony won't be aware of this change. When turning off Collaborative Editing, you discard all the data that Synchrony had and when enabling again, you are forcing to fetch a new copy of the base URL from Confluence. That's how turning it off and on again helps workaround this issue    h5. Turn Collaborative Editing Off Entirely (not recommended)    !https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png|width=16,height=16!   All existing shared drafts are lost when you switch collaborative editing off, so make sure your users have published any work they want to keep before you make the change.   # Go to  !https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/files/590259974/590058056/1/1398739558493/Cog.png! > *General Configuration* > *Collaborative editing*   # Click *Change mode*   # Select *Off*   # Click *Change*   # Then [rebuild the index|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/content-index-administration-148844.html#ContentIndexAdministration-Rebuildingthesearchindex] via the UI   # The issue will stop occurring but you will need to go back and manually restore any pages that were affected  ## You can restore the page to an older version  ## Or you can manually adjust the links    (i) More information can be found in [Administering Collaborative editing|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/administering-collaborative-editing-858772086.html].    If turning off Collaborative Editing is not an option or the affected area is not too big for the instance, there is a workaround that can be applied to a page to fix it on a page to page   basis:  # Edit the affected page that has either _User Mention_ or _Attachment Link_ in it  # Save the page without making any changes (this would break the page due to this bug)  # Revert the page back to the history of 1 version before the current broken version (the version that has all the user mentions and attachment links still intact)    Now that the page has been _affected_ once, any edits after this will not cause the user mentions or attachment links to change again.

There are two known workarounds for this issue:    *1. Update the Oracle JDBC Driver to the latest version (12.2.0.1)*  There is a new version of the Oracle JDBC driver which fixes the cursor leak. Updating your driver prior to upgrading Confluence to 6.1.x will prevent this issue.  To update the driver:  # Stop Confluence, and create a backup of the installation and home directory.  # Download version 12.2.0.1 (or later) of the driver from the Oracle JDBC Driver page.  # Replace the existing ojdbc7.jar in <Confluence installation>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib with the new driver.

It has been a complicated one to solve and we wanted to include a few notes on this fix we have shipped in the 6.15.5 release.    *Adding new emoticons (including Hipchat emoticons) to a page:* This is now fixed. They will be saved in valid storage format (e.g {{<ac:emoticon ac:name=""""smile""""/>}} for standard Confluence emoticons or {{<ac:hipchat-emoticon ac:shortcut=""""name""""/>}} for Hipchat emoticons).  *Existing pages with invalid emoticons and collaborative editing turned OFF:* Viewing or editing the page will display fixed emoticons. Saving the page will correct the storage format of the broken emoticons.  *Existing pages with invalid emoticons and collaborative editing turned ON:* Viewing the page will display fixed emoticons. If there is a current draft with broken emoticons, then the broken emoticons will be displayed once in the editor. On the next save of the page, any invalid emoticons will be fixed.      *For those using Hipchat emoticons*, please note:    If an invalid Hipchat emoticon has the same name as one of the standard Confluence emoticons (such as """"smile"""", """"thumbs-up"""" or """"tick""""), it will be converted into the corresponding Confluence emoticon once the page is saved.      For all cases, saving the page will fix the broken emoticons. We explored the possibility of including a front-end editor fix to automatically resolve all of these broken emoticon instances. As it would involve checking every page and have an ongoing performance impact, we decided against doing this. So, if you come across any broken emoticons, please edit and update/publish your page to resolve the problem.        Thanks again for your understanding.

Problem Definition  It's not possible to deploy an Internal Facing Confluence DC on AWS using the quick start CloudFormation template when using own DNS Server.    This happens because the template uses the DNS to mount the EFS into the new Confluence Node, so the two conditions on EC2 to use the EFS via DNS are:  # The connecting EC2 instance must be inside a VPC and must be configured to use the DNS server provided by Amazon. For information about Amazon DNS server, see DHCP Options Sets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.  # The VPC of the connecting EC2 instance must have DNS host names enabled. For more information, see Viewing DNS Hostnames for Your EC2 Instance in the Amazon VPC User Guide.    h3. Suggested Solution  Make it possible to deploy Confluence DC using our own DNS Server.    h3. Why this is important  Currently we can only deploy internet-facing datacenters, but most of the companies need to deploy dev/staging instances too, that should be accessed internally only due to security policies.     h3.

Manually apply the upgrade task    After the upgrade is completed successfully, we have to apply this task. What we are going to do is to split the query into 2 separate parts.  h5.

"CONFSERVER-53203","08/15/2017 10:35:42",3,"Logs flooded excessively with ""Hazelcast instance is not active!"" once Hazelcast has shut down ""h2. Problem description  In a Data Center configuration, if Hazelcast is shut down on a node (e.g. in a cluster panic) the logs are quickly flooded with stacktraces like the below:      These stacktraces are recorded at the rate of tens/hundreds of times per minute and can quickly fill up the default log configuration of ~120 MB of atlassian-confluence.log files with nothing but these entries. The logs can roll in a matter of minutes.    The reason this is a problem is that it can cause the root cause of the node shutting down (e.g. the cluster panic event) to be rolled off the logs way before administrators have a chance to react/intervene to recover the node or manually pull the logs before rolling off. In other words, this flood of logging can hamper efforts for root cause analysis for large clients.    Ideally, we can log this type of stacktrace *once* and minimize the verbosity future entries of a similar type instead of repeatedly logging the stacktrace.    h2. Workaround  The current workaround is to extend the default logging so that more logs are kept in archive, in order to give administrators a greater window to capture the relevant logs. This can be done my modifying the following two parameters in <confluence_install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties, which influences size of log files and number of logs kept in archive, respectively:      Note however that increasing the logs kept will impact the disk footprint and size of Support Zips generated.""","  2017-04-13 08:41:55,001 ERROR [scheduler_Worker-8] [org.quartz.core.ErrorLogger] schedulerError Unable to notify JobListener(s) of Job to be executed: (Job will NOT be executed!). trigger= DEFAULT.IndexQueueFlusher job= DEFAULT.IndexQueueFlusher  org.quartz.SchedulerException: JobListener 'ScheduledJobListener' threw exception: Problem retrieving a value from cache com.atlassian.bandana.BandanaPersister [See nested exception: com.atlassian.cache.CacheException: Problem retrieving a value from cache com.atlassian.bandana.BandanaPersister]          at org.quartz.core.QuartzScheduler.notifyJobListenersToBeExecuted(QuartzScheduler.java:1951)          at org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.notifyListenersBeginning(JobRunShell.java:364)          at org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:190)          at com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.quartz.ConfluenceQuartzThreadPool.lambda$runInThread$0(ConfluenceQuartzThreadPool.java:16)          at org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:549)  Caused by: com.atlassian.cache.CacheException: Problem retrieving a value from cache com.atlassian.bandana.BandanaPersister          at com.atlassian.cache.hazelcast.HazelcastCache.getOrLoad(HazelcastCache.java:268)          at com.atlassian.cache.hazelcast.HazelcastCache.get(HazelcastCache.java:97)          at com.atlassian.confluence.cache.DefaultConfluenceCache.get(DefaultConfluenceCache.java:46)          at com.atlassian.confluence.cache.ConfluenceMonitoringCache.get(ConfluenceMonitoringCache.java:44)          at com.atlassian.confluence.setup.bandana.ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.retrieve(ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.java:52)          at com.atlassian.bandana.DefaultBandanaManager.getValue(DefaultBandanaManager.java:32)          at com.atlassian.bandana.DefaultBandanaManager.getValue(DefaultBandanaManager.java:24)          at com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.persistence.dao.ClusterSafeScheduledJobDao.getScheduledJobConfiguration(ClusterSafeScheduledJobDao.java:90)          at com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.managers.DefaultScheduledJobStatusManager.getScheduledJobStatus(DefaultScheduledJobStatusManager.java:44)          at com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.listeners.ScheduledJobsListener.lambda$executeWithJobAndJobStatus$2(ScheduledJobsListener.java:107)          at com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.listeners.ScheduledJobsListener$1.doInTransactionWithoutResult(ScheduledJobsListener.java:131)          at org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionCallbackWithoutResult.doInTransaction(TransactionCallbackWithoutResult.java:33)          at org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionTemplate.execute(TransactionTemplate.java:128)          at com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.listeners.ScheduledJobsListener.executeInTransaction(ScheduledJobsListener.java:128)          at com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.listeners.ScheduledJobsListener.executeWithJobAndJobStatus(ScheduledJobsListener.java:102)          at com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.listeners.ScheduledJobsListener.jobToBeExecuted(ScheduledJobsListener.java:59)          at org.quartz.core.QuartzScheduler.notifyJobListenersToBeExecuted(QuartzScheduler.java:1949)          ... 4 more  Caused by: com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstanceNotActiveException: Hazelcast instance is not active!          at com.hazelcast.spi.AbstractDistributedObject.getService(AbstractDistributedObject.java:93)          at com.hazelcast.map.impl.proxy.MapProxySupport.toData(MapProxySupport.java:1046)          at com.hazelcast.map.impl.proxy.MapProxyImpl.get(MapProxyImpl.java:83)          at com.atlassian.cache.hazelcast.HazelcastCache.getOrLoad(HazelcastCache.java:244)          ... 20 more    log4j.appender.confluencelog.MaxFileSize=20480KB  log4j.appender.confluencelog.MaxBackupIndex=5  ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Summary    Frequent deadlocks on the scheduler_run_details table can cause an outage.    The scheduler_run_details table holds the job execution history for both clustered and non-clustered jobs. When a deadlock occurs on this table it prevents the job history from being updated and eventually leads to an outage.  h2.

Symptoms  h4. Application logs      (i) The job name and ID will vary, as this can happen to any non-clustered job in the Confluence cluster.  h4. DB logs    The DB error logs will look similar to what you see here:    Confirm if there is table scanning by running an execution plan against the delete queries - see [Displaying Graphical Execution Plans (SQL Server Management Studio)|https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178071(v=sql.105).aspx] from MS documentation for details of how this can be done in your environment.  h2. Details of the problem    It is possible that multiple nodes are updating the table concurrently, because the table is not for clustered job.    The current implementation of SchedulerRunDetailsDao increases contention as it does purge (delete outdated job details) every time when a new record is added to the table:      Normally, the database should be able to handle these kind of concurrent transactions (as we are deleting things rather than updating the same record). However, it is not handled perfectly by MS SQL Server or MySQL. The situation is escalated and one transaction is chosen to be rolled back as a deadlock victim. This may lead to other symptoms.    These are two queries frequently being deadlocked:    The lack of the indexes is very likely to cause a full table scan during the execution of the delete statements. Adding the indexes in the workaround should significantly reduce the chance of deadlocks.    And another thing is, the design of addRunDetails is not optimal. The purge should be implemented as a cluster wide job rather than part of the add logic. It would eliminate contention completely. Or at least it should be made less frequent (on a daily basis, for example).  h2. Workaround  h4. Option 1    Add the following 2 composite indexes to the SCHEDULER_RUN_DETAILS table, based on the predicates of the two delete statements.    h4. Option 2    After performing the above, deadlocks are still possible if the size of the table is very large (i.e. over 100k rows) due to the frequency of the purge request.    You can try deleting entries in the scheduler_run_details older than 1 day. The SQL query to do this would be something like below, replacing the date with one day ago:    (!) *Important:* You should not run this in production without first testing in your staging environment. You should also take a database backup or dump prior to running this in production. If anything does not work as expected, you can then restore from the backup.    h4. Option 3    You may also try to apply one of the below DB changes:   # Disable lock escalation for the table scheduler_run_details   # Disable page lock for the table scheduler_run_details    The final option would prevent the possibility of a deadlock caused by concurrent purges. Since the purged jobs are obsolete, this shouldn't be a problem.

"CONFSERVER-55274","03/28/2018 19:18:23",5,"OAuth - Service Provider - Session Remover Job is broken ""(!) This issue does not affect Data Center users. Confluence Data Center is currently able to run the clean-up job without problems.    h2. Issue Description  There's a scheduled job executed by Confluence job handler called {{Service Provider Session Remover}} accountable for removing expired OAuth tokens from {{BANDANA}} table. This job is not working properly, and expired tokens are not being cleared as expected. With enough expired tokens in the database, this can eventually lead to an {color:#ff0000}application crash{color} as the logic to handle tokens is negatively impacted by the number of expired and useless entries stored in the database.    h2. Steps to Reproduce  # Set up JIRA + Confluence applinked together through an OAuth relationship  # Add Confluence gadget feed to JIRA  # Create new JIRA Dashboard and add Confluence Page Gadget, do *not* """"Login and Approve""""  # Every time the Dashboard/Gadget is loaded, observe that a new {{com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token.<somestring>}} row gets added in BANDANA table in Confluence, e.g.:  {code:title=bandanakey}  com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token.5IWZaCCOpzibZTUboRNaJU5WmddxePSe  {code}  {code:title=bandanavalue}   <properties>     <property name=""""token"""" value=""""dqgAd6Oc9JU2G4ZuM6ec0PLmkIMf670w""""/>      <property name=""""creationTime"""" value=""""1521048328968""""/>      <property name=""""tokenSecret"""" value=""""ZAN3c7Yu6zEP8pUQVWB25e5odUrsRNbi""""/>        <property name=""""authorization"""" value=""""NONE""""/>      <property name=""""version"""" value=""""V_1_0_A""""/>     <property name=""""properties"""" value=""""      xoauth_app_url=http\://confluence.example.com/rest/gadgets/1.0/g/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.gadgets\:confluence-page-gadget/gadgets/confluence-page-gadget.xml   """"/>      <property name=""""type"""" value=""""REQUEST""""/>        <property name=""""callback"""" value=""""http://jira.example.com/plugins/servlet/gadgets/oauth-callback""""/>      <property name=""""consumerKey"""" value=""""jira:2f5ae229-2135-43a8-bfd4-77f1cd14b3cc""""/>       <property name=""""timeToLive"""" value=""""600000""""/>     </properties>  {code}  # Load the JIRA Dashboard and Gadget several times and observe there are now several such entries in the BANDANA table.  # Leave Confluence running for 8 hours or more to ensure {{Service Provider Session Remover}} runs. It will not and you will be able to see evidence on logs that it has failed to execute. You should have an entry like the one below:  {code}  runJob Scheduled job CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobRunnerKey.Service Provider Session Remover#CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobId.Service Provider Session Remover completed unsuccessfully with response JobRunnerResponse[runOutcome=ABORTED,message='Job has unexpected run mode RUN_LOCALLY'].  {code}    h2. Expected Behavior  The {{Service Provider Session Remover}} runs every 8 hours and clears out the OAuth tokens from BANDANA    h2. Actual Behavior  The {{Service Provider Session Remover}} attempts to run every 8 hours but is aborted. The {{scheduler_run_details}} table shows:  {code}     id    |                               job_id                                |       start_time        | duration | outcome |                 message                   ---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------+---------+-----------------------------------------    428282 | CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobId.Service Provider Session Remover | 2018-03-27 02:56:11.413 |        6 | A       | Job has unexpected run mode RUN_LOCALLY  {code}    h2. Technical details  The above means that if the dashboard is loaded 1000 times, there will be 1000 such entries in the database. These tokens are supposed to be cleared from {{BANDANA}} via the scheduled job {{Service Provider Session Remover}} which runs every 8 hours, however the job is currently broken.    As expired/unused tokens are not removed, instances will eventually hold a huge number of tokens in their database. Due to the logic used in the [OAuth Plugin|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-oauth] and documented in [OAUTH-321|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/OAUTH-321], as the number of tokens in the database grows, so does the complexity of the problem it needs to resolve. This is because when inserting a new token to the database, it will iterate through a list of existing tokens to validate each one of them before inserting a new one.    The intent of this logic is to validate duplicated entries as well as keep the list of usable tokens up to date, however, as the set of data ( n ) that the algorithm needs to resolve gets bigger, so does the complexity of the problem, which demands more computational resources to get resolved, making the algorithm an O (n²) [complexity class|http://bigocheatsheet.com/] one, leading to eventual outages depending on the instance usage and available resources.    h2. Symptoms  The Confluence instances that run into the performance/stability problems due to high number of stored OAuth tokens will observe one or more of the following symptoms:   * High CPU Usage.   * High Memory Usage.   * A huge number of entries in {{BANDANA}} table related to {{Service Provider}} tokens. This can be confirmed by running below query:  {code:sql}   select count (bandanaid) from bandana where BANDANAKEY like '%com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token%';{code}   * Reports of long-running/stuck threads in Tomcat and Confluence logs for /plugins/servlet/oauth/request-token, e.g.:  {code}  14-Mar-2018 00:40:18.482 WARNING [ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Standalone]]] org.apache.catalina.valves.StuckThreadDetectionValve.notifyStuckThreadDetected Thread """"http-nio-8101-exec-12"""" (id=232) has been active for 69,763 milliseconds (since 3/14/18 12:39 AM) to serve the same request for https://confluence.example.com/plugins/servlet/oauth/request-token and may be stuck (configured threshold for this StuckThreadDetectionValve is 60 seconds).

Workaround  As a workaround, we need to clear tokens stored in {{BANDANA}} table manually, since the Scheduled Job is not doing it for us. To do that:   # Shutdown Confluence.   # Connect to your database client.   # {color:#FF0000}Take a backup{color} from your Confluence database in case we may need to revert it to its pre-delete statement state.   # Execute below query:  {code:sql}  delete from BANDANA where BANDANAKEY like 'com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token%' and bandanavalue like '%value=""""REQUEST""""%'  {code}   # Restart the application.    After this is done, you should no longer observe the symptoms caused by this issue, however, users may be prompted to re-authenticate against applications that were relying on the OAuth tokens previously stored in the database once the clean-up is completed.    It is important to highlight that this workaround may need to be repeated from time to time until this bug is solved if symptoms re-occur. Instance administrators may want to setup a trigger in their database clients to execute this routine automatically based upon certain circumstances, like for example, {{BANDANA}} table going full of records if they intend to automate this task.""","  com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token.5IWZaCCOpzibZTUboRNaJU5WmddxePSe     <properties>     <property name=""""token"""" value=""""dqgAd6Oc9JU2G4ZuM6ec0PLmkIMf670w""""/>      <property name=""""creationTime"""" value=""""1521048328968""""/>      <property name=""""tokenSecret"""" value=""""ZAN3c7Yu6zEP8pUQVWB25e5odUrsRNbi""""/>        <property name=""""authorization"""" value=""""NONE""""/>      <property name=""""version"""" value=""""V_1_0_A""""/>     <property name=""""properties"""" value=""""      xoauth_app_url=http\://confluence.example.com/rest/gadgets/1.0/g/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.gadgets\:confluence-page-gadget/gadgets/confluence-page-gadget.xml   """"/>      <property name=""""type"""" value=""""REQUEST""""/>        <property name=""""callback"""" value=""""http://jira.example.com/plugins/servlet/gadgets/oauth-callback""""/>      <property name=""""consumerKey"""" value=""""jira:2f5ae229-2135-43a8-bfd4-77f1cd14b3cc""""/>       <property name=""""timeToLive"""" value=""""600000""""/>     </properties>    runJob Scheduled job CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobRunnerKey.Service Provider Session Remover#CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobId.Service Provider Session Remover completed unsuccessfully with response JobRunnerResponse[runOutcome=ABORTED,message='Job has unexpected run mode RUN_LOCALLY'].       id    |                               job_id                                |       start_time        | duration | outcome |                 message                   ---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------+---------+-----------------------------------------    428282 | CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobId.Service Provider Session Remover | 2018-03-27 02:56:11.413 |        6 | A       | Job has unexpected run mode RUN_LOCALLY     select count (bandanaid) from bandana where BANDANAKEY like '%com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token%';  14-Mar-2018 00:40:18.482 WARNING [ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Standalone]]] org.apache.catalina.valves.StuckThreadDetectionValve.notifyStuckThreadDetected Thread """"http-nio-8101-exec-12"""" (id=232) has been active for 69,763 milliseconds (since 3/14/18 12:39 AM) to serve the same request for https://confluence.example.com/plugins/servlet/oauth/request-token and may be stuck (configured threshold for this StuckThreadDetectionValve is 60 seconds).

There appear to be multiple causes for this issue, but any connection failure to Jira appears to result in a value of {{-1}} being stored in cache for the remote Jira version number.    This causes the version check above to fail as {{-1}} is explicitly listed as an unsupported build version.    Additionally, the cache holds this value for 4 hours, so any subsequent requests for the next 4 hours will also fail with this error.  h3. Environment   * Confluence 6.3.2   * Jira 7.3.9    h3.

Notes    This issue often presents as a single occurrence that is resolved when the cache is cleared 4 hours later. In some cases, it can be persistent.  h3. Workaround    Re-indexing appears to correct this issue as in the process, the relevant cache is cleared in the process.    This may not be an acceptable workaround as if connectivity issues persist, the incorrect value will be stored in cache on the next version request.

The bug lies in the XhtmlContent's implementation and what the class does when a macro definition does not exists or it's not available.    When the xhtmlContent.handleMacroDefinitions method is called with a block of xhtml content which contains a reference to a macro module that has been disabled it will return invalid data - such that it ignores the macros that the disabled macro contains and will conflate the parameters of those macros into the disable MacroDefinition.    xhtmlContent.handleMacroDefinitions will generates invalid data leading to data loss.    In the page we will see this image:   !image1.png|thumbnail!   And if we edit the page, nothing will appear inside the macro:   !image2.png|thumbnail!     The storage format shows that the data exist in the page and the following error appears in the logs:      h4. Replicating the issue    The """"info"""" above is the standard info macro and simple macro was a test macro created to just return the body.    When this situation arises, a call to xhtmlContent.handleMacroDefinitions will result in the first MacroDefinition passed to the MacroDefinitionHandler.handle method being corrupted - the MacroDefinition will have no body, and all of the parameters of the child macros will be conflated into the corrupt definition.    On the event, this bug caused the F4C (Forms for Confluence) migrator to attempt to migrate the content based on invalid data, and thus corrupted the pages.    In the test, if we used the following storage format:    With both """"Simple-macro"""" and """"other-macro"""" enabled, we get these results from the test plugin (which iterates across the macro definitions found by XhtmlContent and outputs the parameters and values)        However, if the """"other-macro"""" have it's module disabled, we see that the """"warn"""" macro content disappears and the arguments are conflated ito the """"other-macro"""" definition.    This will cause data loss on all pages that uses the disabled macro and a separate macro migration tries to use the XhtmlContent to convert markup to MacroDefinition objects so that they can be adjusted and then reformatted out to migrate the content to the new format.    h4. Workaround    Reverting to the page last version fixes the problem, however not all pages have a previous version so it might require a manual intervention to restore an old backup into a staging instance and manually restore lost page contents to production.""","  handleMacroExecutionException Exception executing macro: jira-form-wrapper, with message: Unable to locate projectKey input, use the blueprint to generate a new form and copy/paste the macro back in to the form.    <ac:structured-macro ac:name=""""unknown-macro"""" ac:schema-version=""""1"""" ac:macro-id=""""dcbc25a6-6b81-40bf-9ef8-7a687af59538"""">   <ac:rich-text-body>   <ac:structured-macro ac:name=""""simple-macro"""" ac:schema-version=""""1"""" ac:macro-id=""""dcbc25a6-6b81-40bf-9ef8-7a687af59538"""">   <ac:parameter ac:name=""""simple-macro-param"""">aaa</ac:parameter>   <ac:parameter ac:name=""""atlassian-macro-output-type"""">INLINE</ac:parameter>   <ac:rich-text-body>   <p class=""""auto-cursor-target""""><br/></p>   <ac:structured-macro ac:name=""""info"""" ac:schema-version=""""1"""" ac:macro-id=""""3caf2e75-1b55-48cf-9810-fa3884dd8f94"""">   <ac:parameter ac:name=""""info-macro-param"""">bbb</ac:parameter>   <ac:parameter ac:name=""""icon"""">false</ac:parameter>   <ac:parameter ac:name=""""title"""">title</ac:parameter>   <ac:rich-text-body>   <p>this is some content</p></ac:rich-text-body>   </ac:structured-macro>   <p class=""""auto-cursor-target""""><br/></p>   </ac:rich-text-body>   </ac:structured-macro>   </ac:rich-text-body>  </ac:structured-macro>    <ac:structured-macro ac:name=""""simple-macro"""" ac:schema-version=""""1"""" ac:macro-id=""""dcbc25a6-6b81-40bf-9ef8-7a687af59538"""">      <ac:parameter ac:name=""""simplemacroarg"""">arg</ac:parameter>      <ac:rich-text-body>          <p class=""""auto-cursor-target""""><br/></p>          <ac:structured-macro ac:name=""""other-macro"""" ac:schema-version=""""1"""" ac:macro-id=""""3caf2e75-1b55-48cf-9810-fa3884dd8f94"""">              <ac:parameter ac:name=""""othermacroarg"""">arg</ac:parameter>              <ac:rich-text-body>                  <ac:structured-macro ac:name=""""warn"""" ac:schema-version=""""1"""" ac:macro-id=""""3caf2e75-1b55-48cf-9810-fa3884dd8f94"""">                      <ac:parameter ac:name=""""icon"""">false</ac:parameter>                      <ac:parameter ac:name=""""title"""">title</ac:parameter>                      <ac:rich-text-body>                          <p>this is some content</p></ac:rich-text-body>                  </ac:structured-macro>              </ac:rich-text-body>          </ac:structured-macro>          <p class=""""auto-cursor-target""""><br/></p>          <ac:structured-macro ac:name=""""info"""" ac:schema-version=""""1"""" ac:macro-id=""""3caf2e75-1b55-48cf-9810-fa3884dd8f94"""">              <ac:parameter ac:name=""""icon"""">false</ac:parameter>              <ac:parameter ac:name=""""title"""">title</ac:parameter>              <ac:rich-text-body>                  <p>this is some content</p></ac:rich-text-body>          </ac:structured-macro>          <p class=""""auto-cursor-target""""><br/></p>      </ac:rich-text-body>  </ac:structured-macro>    [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] ----------------------------------  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] All macros enabled  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] warn  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     icon = false  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     title = title  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] other-macro  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     othermacroarg = arg  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] info  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     icon = false  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     title = title  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] simple-macro  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     simplemacroarg = arg  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]    [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] ----------------------------------  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] With other-macro disabled  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] other-macro  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     icon = false  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     othermacroarg = arg  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     title = title  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] info  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     icon = false  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     title = title  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer] simple-macro  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     simplemacroarg = arg  [INFO] [talledLocalContainer]  ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Summary  Based on the [removeStaleSharedDrafts class|https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-confluence/6.2.0/com/atlassian/confluence/pages/PageManager.html#removeStaleSharedDrafts--], a stale draft is defined as:  {quote}Pages with a {{content_status}} '*draft*' and which have a last modified date that is earlier than or equal to the last modified date on the published page.{quote}  However, it is possible that a draft is marked as stale only by definition but in theory, it is still a valid draft. Refer to the 'Steps to reproduce' section for more information.    h3. Steps to reproduce  # Create a new page and insert a task to the page.  # Publish the page.  # Edit the page again to add some text, then close the editor while opting to save it as a draft.  # Run the query in [How to manually remove Stale Drafts from Confluence Database|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-manually-remove-stale-drafts-from-confluence-database-951392345.html] to confirm that a stale draft doesn't exist yet in the DB.     # On the page in 'View' mode, mark the task as completed. This creates a new version of the page without the draft being published.  # Run the query in step #4 again and we will see that there is one stale draft.  # Set Collaborative Editing to 'Off' or 'Limited' and then to 'On' to trigger the stale draft removal process.    h3. Expected results  The draft should not be removed despite it fitting the definition/criteria of a stale draft.    h3. Actual results  The draft is removed because the draft's {{lastmoddate}} is earlier than the page's {{lastmoddate}}, which fits the definition of a stale draft.    h3. Workaround  Before turning Collaborative Editing ON you can retrieve information from possibly affected pages by running the query below.  With that information, Confluence administrators will be able to share the draft content if a user asks for it.

"CONFSERVER-57541","11/20/2018 12:37:24",5,"Companion App MSI should automatically startup on next login after install ""h2. Problem Definition    Currently when the Companion App MSI file is deployed by admins wishing to roll out this feature to multiple Windows machines the app still needs to be manually started before it can make the system call to add it to launch at startup. Customers have run into this issue and see that only after running the app manually the registry entry is placed here: {{HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run}}    This differs from the normal installer behaviour (.exe) which does launch the Companion App after installing. However, MSIs are usually installed via an admin account, so having the executable launch automatically after installation will not solve the problem (as this will only add the registry entry for the admin user).   h3. Current scenario:    After user runs the App for the first time, the registry key will be added in the following path    h2. Workaround:    The registry key can be added to HKCU (for all users that should have Companion running) during the deployment to ensure that the app is started automatically without having the user to start it manually.    For 32-bit OS:    For 64-bit OS:         As of Companion 0.6.0, a registry key can alternatively be manually added to HKLM (instead of HKCU) with no side effects. This will allow Companion to automatically launch for all users on the machine. The process will be the same as above, but adding the registry key to HKLM:     {{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run}}     ""","  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run  msiexec /qn /i """"Atlassian Companion.msi""""  reg add """"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"""" /v """"electron.app.Atlassian Companion"""" /d """"C:\Program Files\Atlassian Companion\Atlassian Companion.exe --was-opened-at-login"""" /f    msiexec /qn /i """"Atlassian Companion.msi""""  reg add """"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"""" /v """"electron.app.Atlassian Companion"""" /d """"C:\Program Files (x86)\Atlassian Companion\Atlassian Companion.exe --was-opened-at-login"""" /f  ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Even though this is not triggered under normal circumstances, the idea of this bug is that one of the following situations must be avoided:   # The app should check if it is already running before starting a new process, or   # If the possibility of having two processes is expected, the secondary process should not leak memory    If the app has one of those protection mechanisms bundled, we exclude the possibility of compromising the end-user computer resources.  h3. Workaround 1    Remove one of the registry entries (either from HKLM or HKCU tree), which can be done by an administrator. Only one of the following entries must exist in the registry:      (!) For a 64 bit OS, the registry tree looks like this:    h3. Workaround 2    Uncheck the *Launch at startup* box on the app itself, which can be done by the end user.

Summary    A bug in 6.11.0 to 6.15.2 leads to the Create Space dialog not loading, and giving an  """"unknown server error"""" in the UI after clicking on the Create Space button.    A pre-exiting KB has almost 100% effectiveness with some exceptions that are environmental, not the application. Here's the KB:   - [https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/creating-new-page-or-space-loads-forever-744329880.html]    This was caused by the space blueprints table AO_54C900_SPACE_BLUEPRINT_AO containing a reference to a blueprint that was no longer available.  E.g. the plugin that included the blueprint has been uninstalled.    Another situation is where the blueprint was partially enabled.    This bug is fixed in 6.13.5 and 6.15.3.      h3. Logs    This is the logging by default that is used to identify the problem:    Logs with debug on for AO:    It happens on UPGRADES from 6.x to 6.11.x or later versions and it happens with all databases, no common plugin used, dropping/truncating the tables always resolve the problem, with just one exception.    h3. Steps to reproduce    There are a few ways to reproduce it.  The most common and dangerous is:   * Create a space using the a space blueprint   * Disable the plugin module that provides that space blueprint   * Upgrade to 6.11.x or above   * Try to create a space    The """"it happens on upgrade"""" is because the bug was introduced there, and in previous versions it was fine to disable the space blueprint of a plugin module.   * When using 6.11.x or above   * Create a space using the a space blueprint   * Disable the plugin module that provides that space blueprint   * Try to create a space    Another way is to just disable a space blueprint plugin module without disabling the space blueprint item module, e.g.   * When using 6.11.x or above   * Go to Manage apps   * Turn off the team-space-blueprint module   * Try to create a space    h3. Workarounds    * Upgrade to 6.15.3 or 6.13.5  * Create spaces using the old UI.  You don't get to choose a space type, but you can still create spaces.  Start at http://<baseurl>/<contextpath>/spaces/createspace-start.action  * If you have disabled or uninstalled any space blueprint plugins or plugin modules you used to use, then re-enable them  * If those aren't enough, follow this KB to delete old space blueprint use from the database [https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/creating-new-page-or-space-loads-forever-744329880.html]""","  2019-01-23 15:19:28,291 WARN [http-nio-8090-exec-4] [confluence.impl.hibernate.ConfluenceHibernateTransactionManager] doRollback Performing rollback.

Issue Summary    When editing the Jira *Filter Results* macro, the """"fields to display"""" are unable to be edited. They are unable to be removed or sorted.  h3. Steps to Reproduce   # Use a Confluence instance with an application link to Jira.   # Create a new page and add the Jira *Filter Results* macro.   # Select the macro and click on Edit.   # In the preview pane, at the bottom of the list, click on the cogwheel icon and then Edit.   # Attempt to   ## Remove a field from the list of Fields to display, by clicking on the bin icon.   ## Reorder a field    h3. Expected Results    The field is removed / reordered from the list.  h3. Actual Results    Nothing happens, the field stays in the list.   Check the attached video [^DeleteField-FilterResultsMacro.mp4] for a recording of the issue's reproduction.  h3.

"CONFSERVER-58642","07/30/2019 01:19:32",3,"Subscribing to Team Calendars in Confluence with events from restricted or inexistent Jira projects might fail ""h3. Issue Summary  Confluence users can subscribe to Team Calendars and get an updated list of events from Confluence in their preferred calendar _app_ as described in [Subscribe to and from Team Calendars|https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/subscribe-to-and-from-team-calendars-273285883.html].  If users subscribe to a Calendar that has events from a restricted or an inexistent Jira project (see [Add Jira Events|https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/add-jira-events-241566244.html] for further information), then Confluence will throw an error instead of gracefully bypassing events associated to that project.    h3. Steps to Reproduce  # Install a vanilla instance of Jira Software.   #* This was validated with Jira Software 7.9.2 but should not be tied to a specific Jira version.  # As the Jira administrator, create a sample project.   ## Go to *Projects* > *Create project* > *Create sample data*.   ## Select *Project management* and click on *Next*.   ## Use the following information to create the project: _Name_: {{Test Project}} ; _Key_: {{TSTPRJ}}; _Project Lead_: {{jira administrator}}  # Restrict the _Browse Projects_ permissions just to Jira administrators, removing the permission to any logged user.  # Create a regular Jira user, which is added just to the {{jira-software-users}} group.   #* _username_: {{user001}}  # Install a vanilla instance of Confluence.   #* This was validated with Confluence 6.13.3 but should not be tied to a specific Confluence version.  # [Install Team Calendars|https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/install-team-calendars-241566248.html].   #* This was validated with Team Calendars 6.0.37.  # Create a regular Confluence user, which is added just to the {{confluence-users}} group.   #* _username_: {{user001}}  # Create an application link between Confluence and Jira.  # Create a blank space: _Space Name_: {{Test-Team-Calendars}}; _Space Key_: {{TTC}}  # Go to {{<Confluence Base URL>/display/TTC/calendars}} and add a new calendar.   #* _Name_: {{Test Calendar}}  # Within _Test Calendar_, click on *...* > *Add event*.   #* Select _Event Type_: {{Jira Issue Dates}}; _Name_: {{Test Project Calendar}}; _Display_: {{JQL (advanced)}}; _JQL_: {{project = """"Test Project""""}}; _Show_: {{Issue Created Date}}   #* At this point the events are added and the administrator has visibility to the events in the calendar.   # As {{user001}} access {{<Confluence Base URL>/display/TTC/calendars}} and click on _Subscribe_.   #* Choose _Calendar_: {{Test Calendar}}; _Calendar app_: {{iCal}}  # Copy the _Team Calendars URL_ and paste it in the browser.    h3. Expected Results  A pop-up is given by the browser so the user can download an _.ics_ file.  Confluence gracefully handles the fact the Jira project is restricted and doesn't include events from this sub-calendar, but still shows events from other sub-calendars.    h3. Actual Results  Confluence answers with HTTP 500 status and with a {{java.lang.NullPointerException}} to the user.  An error similar to the below is logged in {{atlassian-confluence.log}}:      The user is unable to subscribe to the Calendar.    h3. Notes  The same problem occurs if the target project is unrestricted in Jira, but had its name/key changed after the calendar was created in Confluence, invalidating the JQL query.    h3. Workaround  There's no straightforward workaround to the _subscribe use case_ and still keep the original data in Confluence.  The problematic JQL can be determined by the error in Confluence log.  One of the following options can be used with their possible consequences:   * If the Jira project was renamed, then search for the Calendars pointing to it and update the JQL filter.   * If the Jira project was removed, then search for the event pointing to it and remove it.   * If the Jira project is restricted to certain users, removing it from a _public_ calendar may be an option to certain use cases.    If applicable, exporting the calendar to an _.ics_ file as explained in [this KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/export-team-calendars-content-to-other-calendars-240913738.html] still works.

Issue Summary  Given a Confluence page with a lot of content and has inline comments, navigating between the inline comments will glitch, should the following conditions are met:  # The page contains a warn/info macro with inline comments.   # The above macro is located at the area of page that requires the user to scroll down to view it. (The issue does not happen if the macro is located at the top of the page)  When navigating through all the inline comments using the top and bottom arrows on the left side of the inline comment section, the navigation glitches when you hit the inline comment that is located in the warn/info macro.    In normal cases, when a user navigates through the inline comments the page will auto scroll to the text referred to by a specific inline comment.

Workaround    Disabling the [Scheduled Job|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/scheduled-jobs-96567525.html] scheduledjob.desc.cleanupTrigger may *not* stop the job from running. This is due to a new bug that disabling a system scheduled job (e.g. cleanupTrigger) continues to run post restart of Confluence:   - CONFSERVER-59501 - Disabling a system scheduled job continues to run post restart of Confluence    In order to properly disable it, we need to *disable* the *Office Connector* module related to the {{cleanupTrigger}} job.   # Navigate to Manage Apps in Confluence (requires Confluence admin permission)   # Filter it by *System* apps and search for *_Office Connector Plugin_*. Click on it to expand.   # Click on *Modules* to expand the list and look for {{File Cache Cleanup (cleanupTrigger)}}.   # Leave the mouse cursor on it and the *Disable* button will show up. Click on it.   (!) For broken files, it's necessary to reupload in order to recreate them.
