This modification was erroneous, and causes incorrect results when the console module is applied against a multi-level page hierarchy.   Specifically, the subsequent loop assumes an ordering of the following form:   Tab Level 1 Sort 1 Tab Level 1 Sort 2     Tab Level 2 Sort 1     Tab Level 2 Sort 2 Tab Level 1 Sort 3     Tab Level 2 Sort 1         Tab Level 3 Sort 1   However, the ordering identified above does not perform this sorting.  If the GetTabsBySortOrder call does not return an ordering with recursive grouping (I&apos;m not sure whether it does), additional work will need to be performed to achieve the desired ordering.   At a minimum, the modification should be removed to read:     if ((IsHostTab()))     tempTabs = TabController.GetTabsBySortOrder(Null.NullInteger); else     tempTabs = TabController.GetTabsBySortOrder(PortalId);     (Extraneous brackets removed due to lame-ness.)

In DNN6 this could be done using a special skin, but, in 7, the command bar is injected at the top of the page and so the skin approach doesn&apos;t work.   The procedure that injects the command bar is in Skin.cs. Before doing so, it evaluates two querystring parameters - popup and dnnprintmode. Both of those hide the command bar, but, both also do other things.    I think we should add a third parameter - hidecommandbar.

User can choose to completely hide the treeview pane or show it in its standard width. But there is no way to adjust to width of this pane. A scrollbar appears on the bottom, using which the user can scroll to a folder that is buried deep into the subfolders, but this is still very painful to use. I can imagine how difficult this will be when the folder structure is at an enterprise level. As far as I can remember, I have always hated to scroll horizontally. User gets&nbsp;claustrophobic&nbsp;after a few minutes of using the folder treeview.  Proposed enhancement:&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the treeview pane is visible, the user should be able to adjust the width. On the border, the icon should change to a double-sided arrow in order for the user to drag it.&nbsp; When the treeview pane is not visible, the user should NOT be able to adjust the width. When adjusting the width, the user should NOT be able to reduce the width. When adjusting the width, the user should be able to increase the width to a MAX of double the standard width (no more). When the toggle button is clicked, the treeview hides completely no matter what the current width of the treeview was. For every change in width, the horizontal scrollbar should adjust accordingly. Nice to have: The width of the ""Name"" column on the main gridview should adjust according to the changing width of the treeview panel as the user adjusts the panel widths. The width of all other columns on the gridview stays the same. Now, we are talking! Horizontal Scrollbar still exists just in case the folder structure is really deep.&nbsp;",2

I have for example an HTML module with a lot of javascript in the head section of the settings and only one simple canvas element in the content. Exporting content only exports the canvas and nothing else. Solution: DNN has internal methods for saving a complete page or even a complete website as a template, with all settings. But when exporting and importing module content, these methods are not used. Instead there is a special solution for this which only fetches the content and nothing else. Attachment: I attached 3 changed files of the core which changes this behaviour to the standard DNN way and allows to export and import a module with all the settings. There are only minor changes in codebehind of export.ascx and import.ascx and 1 new method in ModuleController.cs. If an old template is selected for import, import goes the old way and a new template imports the whole thing with settings and permissions Enhancements: I did not change the UI of import.ascx. Perhaps it would be a great enhancement to add some checkboxes like: Include Settings, Include Content, Include Permissions. If IncludeContent is checked by default and the others not this is the behaviour like before.

If you find the module instances in the XML and replace &lt;alltabs&gt;true&lt;/alltabs&gt; with &lt;alltabs&gt;false&lt;/alltabs&gt; and generate another portal then the modules show up, albeit without that setting enabled. I marked this as a show stopper because this could be crippling to a site that relies heavily on the ""display on all pages"" setting. We could not replicate this bug on DNN6.2.6 and DNN7.0.3",5

The page URL input line could have three different meaningful inputs – Text line with current not changed page URL, Text line for new URL, or empty field to rollback for the default page URL.    With all that possibilities we have 24 different scenarios:  5 of them have intuitively understandable expected result – nothing were change result,     1 of them (type a new URL and click both Update button sequentially) have intuitively understandable expected result – the page URL was changes to the new input), and     1 of them (Clear URL input line and click both Update button sequentially) have intuitively understandable expected result – the page URL was changes to the default page URL (set on the page creation.    All other 17 scenarios have or non-intuitively understandable expected results or hard to understand expected results.    In such situation there is no surprise the actual behavior of functionality do not equal to any expected results, and introduce a new result for some scenarios – create a permanent redirection to 404 page.

"DNN-3371","08/16/2013 00:27:13","Search > Journal Crawler (mini spike)","Currently the Site Crawler in the Platform does not crawl Journal items. Journal integration with Search is a bit tricky as Journal has a different permission system as compared with module / tab permissions. There are two ways this integration can be done:    *Treat Journal as Module and implement ModuleSearchBase*    1) The advantage of this approach is that all you need to implement is ModuleSearchBase and the content will start to get indexed by Site Crawler.  2) However, there is a downside that Journal has a different permission system then typical module / tab permission. During indexing, one would need to translate Journal’s permission into module type permission so Search can do security trimming.    *New Crawler - Create a new SearchType for Journal*    1) This approach allows checking of Journal permission at querying time.  2) This SearchType should implement BaseResultController, especially the HasViewPermission method. GetDocUrl method in this method is marked as abstract, but isn't called if Url is already stored in the SearchDocument.  3) There is no need to create a separate scheduled tasked. All we need to do is modify Site Crawler to call into Journal to obtain SearchDocuments. Site Crawler currently crawls through tab and module metadata and collects SearchDocuments from modules that implement ISearchable or ModuleSearchBase.   4) When user performs a query and hits are found in Journal, system will call HasViewPermission method every hit in Lucene. This will require a DB hit to check permission, which is a down-side.   5) Make sure the SearchType is not marked as Private.  In reality 90% of Journal entries are Public (except for ones in a Social Group), a mixed approach can be done, where permission is stored in the Index for all the public items so there isn’t a hit.    *Due to the above I call this as a mini-spike*  ",8

"DNN-3754","09/05/2013 00:58:25","SI: Redirect after registration not working","Description - Customer has provided us with a bug that they found. Customers email following:    The logic in the if...else code block that checks if a Redirect_AfterRegistration page was set in Portal Settings, and sets the RedirectURL accordingly, is backwards. If a redirect page was set, the value of the    ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"" portal setting returned is a positive integer value corresponding to the TabID of the page the new user should be redirected to after registration. If no page was set, or if the Administrator manually selects    ""<None Specified>"" for this setting, then the value returned is -1. Therefore, the logic in this code block (as currently shipped in version 7.1.1) is backwards and results in new users being redirected incorrectly after registering on    the site.    When the logic checks if the setting is > 0, it should redirect to the URL of the TabID set for the after registration page. Otherwise, if a positive value was not returned (ie. no redirect after registration page was set), it should    then begin the code block to check for the returnurl parameter value (if sent in querystring), or remain on the same page if no returnurl parameter value was specified. The current code's logic blocks need flip flopped to work as    designed.    STEPS TO REPRODUCE:    1. In Site Settings > User Account Settings > Registration Settings, set the User Registration type to ""Public"", Registration Form Type to ""Standard"", and set Redirect After Registration dropdown to any page (except the Home or Getting    Started pages) that is viewable by Registered Users. Be sure to Save settings.  2. If it is not already set, temporarily set View permissions on the Getting Started page to allow viewing by Registered Users.  3. Logout.  4. Navigate to registration page with a manually set ""returnurl"" parameter value in the querystring that would return you to the Getting Started page, as such: /?ctl=register&returnurl=%2fGettingStarted.aspx  5. Fill out the registration form as a new user and click ""Register"".  6. Note that instead of being redirected to the page you selected in the Redirect After Registration settings dropdown (which is where you should have been redirected to), you are redirected to the Getting Started page, which was passed    as the returnurl parameter value in querystring.    (NOTE: If you do not select a page for Redirect After Registration in the Site Settings, then you are always redirected to 404 or Home page (relative url path = ""/"") regardless of value for returnurl parameter. The reversed logic sees    that the value is not > 0, so in the else, it tries to redirect you to page with ID of the returned setting value (which in the case where none was set, the returned value is -1). There is no page found with ID = -1 when NavigateURL    tries to resolve it.)    CURRENT CODE (BUG is found in Lines 138-166 of \DesktopModules\Admin\Security\Register.ascx.cs):      protected string RedirectURL  {  get  {  string _RedirectURL = """";    object setting = GetSetting(PortalId, ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"");    if (Convert.ToInt32(setting) > 0)  {  if (Request.QueryString[""returnurl""] != null)  {  //return to the url passed to register  _RedirectURL = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString[""returnurl""]);  //redirect url should never contain a protocol ( if it does, it is likely a cross-site request forgery attempt )  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""://""))  {  _RedirectURL = """";  }  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""?returnurl""))  {  string baseURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(0, _RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal));  string returnURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(_RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal) + 11);    _RedirectURL = string.Concat(baseURL, ""?returnurl"", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(returnURL));  }  }  if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(_RedirectURL))  {  //redirect to current page  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL();  }  }  else //redirect to after registration page  {  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL(Convert.ToInt32(setting));  }  return _RedirectURL;  }  }    CODE FIX (Reversing the conditional logic Code Blocks resolves this bug and the New User is redirected correctly after registering.):      protected string RedirectURL  {  get  {  string _RedirectURL = """";    object setting = GetSetting(PortalId, ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"");    if (Convert.ToInt32(setting) > 0) //redirect to after registration page  {  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL(Convert.ToInt32(setting));  }  else  {  if (Request.QueryString[""returnurl""] != null)  {  //return to the url passed to register  _RedirectURL = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString[""returnurl""]);  //redirect url should never contain a protocol ( if it does, it is likely a cross-site request forgery attempt )  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""://""))  {  _RedirectURL = """";  }  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""?returnurl""))  {  string baseURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(0, _RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal));  string returnURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(_RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal) + 11);    _RedirectURL = string.Concat(baseURL, ""?returnurl"", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(returnURL));  }  }  if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(_RedirectURL))  {  //redirect to current page  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL();  }    }  return _RedirectURL;  }  }",1

"DNN-3727","09/24/2013 19:35:12","DOCTYPE Doesn't Follow Normal Skinning Engine Filename Logic","Normally, a skin designer can create files that either match skin.extension or skinname.extension and they will be known, parsed, and used in the following order:    1.  skinname.extension  2.  skin.extension    An example of this is skin.css and skinname.css.      DOCTYPE does not follow this pattern, causing unnecessary work for many designers.  Skin designers should be able to use a single DOCTYPE configuration file for their entire skin package, should the use case require it.  As is, the TabInfo.cs class only looks for skinname.doctype.xml.      Attached is a suggested code fix to allow DOCTYPE to follow the same skinning engine rules as other kinds of files.

After doing some soul searching, I was able to track down the cause of the problem, and come up with a solution. The problem comes from the fact that I previously used the Ifinity FriendlyUrl Provider for DNN. Even though I am no longer using it, the DLL for the provider still exists within my installation's BIN folder. Something in DNN 7.1.2 changed, and now there is a conflict with this DLL. You'll need to delete the iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider.dll from your website's BIN folder. You will also need to find any references to the DLL/NameSpaces in your web.config file.    Replace this (this first one probably isn't used in IIS 7+ websites, but if your web.config has it, change it)    <add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""iFinity.DNN.Modules.FriendlyUrl.UrlRewriteModule, iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider"" />    with this    <add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""DotNetNuke.HttpModules.UrlRewriteModule, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" />    and replace this    <add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""iFinity.DNN.Modules.FriendlyUrl.UrlRewriteModule, iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider"" preCondition=""managedHandler"" />    with this    <add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""DotNetNuke.HttpModules.UrlRewriteModule, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" preCondition=""managedHandler"" />    Then finally your friendlyUrl section of the web.config should most likely look like this       <friendlyUrl defaultProvider=""DNNFriendlyUrl"">      <providers>          <clear />           <add name=""DNNFriendlyUrl"" type=""DotNetNuke.Services.Url.FriendlyUrl.DNNFriendlyUrlProvider, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" includePageName=""true"" regexMatch=""[^a-zA-Z0-9 _-]"" urlFormat=""Advanced"" />      </providers>  </friendlyUrl>",1

This would look something like this:  {code}  <component type=""Config"" fileName=""Install.xml"" unInstallFileName=""Uninstall.xml"" />  {code}    However, there is a null reference exception that occurs when the {{ConfigInstaller}} tries to commit the change.  This is because the installer is trying to reference {{TargetFile.FullName}}, but {{TargetFile}} is only set when the {{fileName}} attribute _isn't_ set on the component.    The simple fix would be to check whether {{TargetFile}} is {{null}}.  But this overlooks the bigger issue, which is that when the XML Merge script is in a different file, the changes in it are applied directly to the target file (e.g. web.config).  This is in contrast to when the XML Merge script is included inline (and to components of other types) which apply changes to temporary files and then commit once the changes are verified as successful.    So, in this case where the installation fails because of the null reference exception, those XML Merge changes to the web.config are still applied to the site, and not rolled back, because they took place against the site's web.config already, before the Commit stage.",2

The first place to look is in the UserOnlineController.SetUserList function – when and where this is called and if it could lead to a thread unsafe operation.    exception:    2013-10-31 02:30:00,567 [RD00155D4440AF][Thread:65][FATAL] DotNetNuke.Web.Common.Internal.DotNetNukeHttpApplication - System.InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.     at System.Collections.Hashtable.GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.WriteObjectInfo.InitSerialize(Object obj, ISurrogateSelector surrogateSelector, StreamingContext context, SerObjectInfoInit serObjectInfoInit, IFormatterConverter converter, ObjectWriter objectWriter, SerializationBinder binder)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.WriteObjectInfo.Serialize(Object obj, ISurrogateSelector surrogateSelector, StreamingContext context, SerObjectInfoInit serObjectInfoInit, IFormatterConverter converter, ObjectWriter objectWriter, SerializationBinder binder)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.ObjectWriter.Serialize(Object graph, Header[] inHeaders, __BinaryWriter serWriter, Boolean fCheck)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter.Serialize(Stream serializationStream, Object graph, Header[] headers, Boolean fCheck)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter.Serialize(Stream serializationStream, Object graph, Header[] headers)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCacheObjectSerializationProvider.SerializeUserObject(Object userObject, Boolean isCompressionEnabled, ValueFlagsVersion flagsType)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.SocketClientProtocol.Upsert(VelocityPacketType type, String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.SocketClientProtocol.Put(String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.InternalPut(String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.<>c__DisplayClass4a.<Put>b__49()     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.Put(String key, Object value, TimeSpan timeout, IEnumerable`1 tags, String region)     at DotNetNuke.Providers.CachingProviders.AzureCachingProvider.AzureCachingProvider.Put(String cacheKey, Object itemToCache, DateTime absoluteExpiration, TimeSpan slidingExpiration)     at DotNetNuke.Providers.CachingProviders.AzureCachingProvider.AzureCachingProvider.Insert(String cacheKey, Object itemToCache, DNNCacheDependency dependency, DateTime absoluteExpiration, TimeSpan slidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority priority, CacheItemRemovedCallback onRemoveCallback)     at DotNetNuke.Common.Utilities.DataCache.SetCache(String CacheKey, Object objObject, DNNCacheDependency objDependency, DateTime AbsoluteExpiration, TimeSpan SlidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority Priority, CacheItemRemovedCallback OnRemoveCallback)     at DotNetNuke.Entities.Users.UserOnlineController.SetUserList(Hashtable userList)     at DotNetNuke.Entities.Users.UserOnlineController.TrackAuthenticatedUser(HttpContext context)     at System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute()     at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean& completedSynchronously)  ",1

(DNN version 6.2.5). The problem did not manifest itself on our single core test-environment, nor in our development environments. There also seemed to be no relation between any particular request and the probability of the problem occurring.    I made dumps using DebugDiag and the (32 bit version of) taskmanager. Analyses of the dumps with WinDbg  showed all of the runaway threads busy with an Insert call on a generic dictionary in the UserController.GetCachedUser method.    This method indeed gets a dictionary from the cache and sets a value on it. The dictionary is a common generic dictionary, not thread-safe. However the object is shared among threads through the cache, and thus a thread-safe dictionary should be used.    I have fixed this by changing line 242 in method UserController.GetUserLookupDictionary so that the CBO.GetCachedObject overload with the saveInDictionary parameter is used, having set the saveInDictionary  parameter to true.    I have attached the fixed version of UserController.cs. See lines 242-251    This bug probably also affects all 7+ versions and earlier 6.. versions. because the offending methods have not been changed.    So far, the high CPU problem has not returned in the past 24 hours. Before the fix, the problem would manifest itself one or more times per hour.

"DNN-4664","01/15/2014 03:40:44","Allow 404 Exception Bubbling from Modules","This item relates to the ability for a third-party module to raise a 404 and have the standard DNN 404 handler catch and handle it.    The DNN 404 handler does the following things:  1) logs the 404 to a special 404 exception type  2) shows the portal-specific 404 page  3) sends back a 'true' 404 status code, instead of the asp.net standard of generating a 302 redirect to an error page.    When module developers wish to intentionally throw a 404 error in their code (such as when a wrong-for-the-module URL is requested, such as a non-existent blog post), they cannot currently get the DNN 404 handler to deal with this.  This is because the general-exception handling catches any raised 404 exception, and turns it over to the general exception handling behaviour, which is to show an error page.    The requirements for this change are to:  1) Allow a module developer to raise a 404 exception in their module code  2) Have an unhandled 404 exception bubble up until it is in the main DNN Exception handling code (for the page lifecycle)  3) Have 404 exceptions passed-through as a special case to the URL Rewriting 404 Handling code, so that it will return a 404 status code and show the portal-specific 404 page.    Test Case  -------------  For the test case, a module will have to be built which has a simple way of generating a 404.  This is suggested to be a simple module with a view control that returns a 404 if you reuqest a set URL (ie /status/404) for the page the module exists on.  This module should be built as part of making the change and provided to the QA team.   The module should also have a way of generating a 'generic' 500 exception, to show that the normal exception handling is not affected (ie /status/500)    Step 1 : Verify that 404 handling is working as expected (example.com/junkurl)  Step 2 : Install the exception-testing module  Step 3 : Request a 404 Exception    -Expected Result-  Shows the same 404 page as Step 1    Step 4: Request a 500 Exception  -Expected Result-  Shows the DNN error page, and not the 404 page.",8

There is a known (and fixed) issue in JSMin.c that causes it to not correctly parse regex strings like /[/']/ as the 2nd / is interpreted as the end of the regex.    Here is a link to the github diff that shows the fix. https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSMin/commit/55809e6d07be4a0d3029d48112d16ef833e55cf7    The version of JSMin.cs (DNN Platform/Components/ClientDependency/Source/CompositeFiles/JSMin.cs) in DNN has a date stamp of 5/22/2007 and the date stamp of this fix is 1/22/2011.     I propose two things:    First, we should update JSMin to a more up-to-date version.   Second, in the event that JSMin fails and returns and empty string, rather than putting nothing in the combined/minified file, we should put the non-minified file in it's place so that major functionality is less likely to be broken by the minification feature.

"DNN-5613","07/15/2014 19:06:56","SI: Problem with Module Controller and 17k value","Customer has reported a bug that is present in the Core DNN API which affects the module settings table when a character of size 17k is added to the column SettingValue.    From Customer:     Here is a screencast of the bug happening and being debugged in DNN's code:  http://screencast.com/t/PcaQrv6W  We've investigated this method (UpdateModuleSettingInternal) further and we have found what is the problem.  ModuleController.cs line 685  The method uses a datareader in order to determine if a setting already exists in the ModuleSettings table and add or update the setting as it is appropriate. This is a VERY bad idea, DataReaders keep their connection with the tables they use open while they themselves are not closed, at least partially. You can imagine that trying to update a table that is being kept open milliseconds before can eventually result in a deadlock. That is what is happening in this case.  When the datareader reads the 17Kb Lorem ipsum that was already uploaded to ModuleSettings, the table gets locked, so when the code gets to ""dataProvider.UpdateModuleSetting(moduleId, settingName, settingValue, UserController.Instance.GetCurrentUserInfo().UserID);"" and calls the SP that updates ModuleSettings, the SP hangs when trying to update the table.  Since the data we where modifying in the table was already there, we commented in UpdateModuleSettingInternal all that had to do with the datareader and AddModuleSetting. This made the code work flawlessly every time instead of hanging every time.  Possible solution for this: My approach would be something like removing the datareader, and instead checking for an existing row at stored procedure level. The ""If exists"" statement has a better performance and has the perk of not locking the table after it has run. Then, in case the row exists, insert or update as needed.  Of course, this is just a suggestion, but bear in mind that since the column SettingValue is nvarchar(max), large values are not beyond the scope of what could happen (and we have proved it happened in one of our clients).  We just wanted to let you know of the problem and a possible fix. Let me know if I can be of any futher help with this issue.      Please see attached ticket for more details on this issue.      ",2

The enhancement proposal is to add a flag to the NotificationType table, to specify if the notification should be displayed in the task list:  - The logic in Social_cmx_GetTasks SPROC will be simplified  - The default value should be false (each notification type needs to be updated in Content/Social to set this to true; taking into consideration upgrades vs. new installations)  - This column, IsTask, should be created via the Platform as a bit column and have all values set to 0 (false) then add a constraint for NOT NULL.   - The API that exists today (for creating notification types) should create an overload method passing a default value of 0 (and also mark existing method as obsolete; only required if the method today is parameterized)    Note: The solution here must work for both Content & Social.

This process consists in the following steps:  1. Get all the SearchDocuments that has not been indexed since last execution. A SearchDocument is each piece of content in DNN.  2. Delete the previous existing stored indexed version of each document (if it exists).  3. Index and store all the SearchDocuments of 1.  The step 2 is done by comparing some fields of the stored search documents with the fields of the new search document. The problem is that in this comparison the fields ""Keywords"" and the fields ""NumericKeys"" are used to compare. This is not correct, because they may change for the same document. Imagine this situation:    - A content is added to the site and it is indexed    - Afterwards, this content is edited and a new keywork is added to it    - The indexing is run again and it detects that it is a new document (has a different keyword of the already indexed one)    - A user performs a search using a word of the body of the content and he/she gets 2 results, each one for the same content.

This was a crucial step for customers managing multiple portals and multiple installations of DNN. Every time a some user controls on a few modules were updated, deployment used to take about an entire night doing most of these steps manually on all portals and all servers. While now, this can be done in minutes.    This can be done from:    * Command line. A new tool was created called *dnncmd.exe*  * TFS Build Agent. A set of custom TFS Build Agent activies were created in order to publish modules (or extensions) right after the DNN package is created on the TFS build agent.  * From code.

These tokens will use a new token pattern: [Token: {propertybag}]    Token Type 1:  [JavaScript : { url: http://jquery.com/blah }]  [JavaScript : { url: http://jquery.com/blah, priority: 1 }]  [JavaScript : { path: /jquery.js, priority: 1, provider: head }]    These tokens will call the standard DnnJSInclude methods with the defined parameters.  The propertybag is a standard JSON object and includes parameter names and values which are used to call the appropriate include methods. The order of properties in the propertybag is unimportant and should not impact the ability to bind to the appropriate JSInclude methods.    Token Type 2:  [JavaScript : { jsname: ""jquery"" }]  [JavaScript : { jsname: ""jquery"", version: ""1.10.0"" }]  [JavaScript : { jsname: ""jquery"", version: ""1.10.0"", specific: ""LatestMajor"" }]    This token variation will load predefined JavaScript packages which have been installed as JavaScript extensions. This token should just be a call to the RequestRegistration call on the JavaScript class with the appropriate parameters.    h2. Conversation  The JavaScript token should be implemented as a standard DNN token which is usable by any module using the TokenReplace engine.  This token should be disabled by default and a module must affirmatively indicate that this replacement should be enabled.    h2. Confirmation  ",2

"DNN-6919","04/28/2015 03:14:50","Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release","DNN upgrades are based on a 3 part version number representing the platform, major and minor version numbers.  Each version component uses a 2 digit integer with a leading zero for padding (e.g. 01.02.03).  This version number uniquely identifies a release and is used as an identifier when creating database upgrade scripts.  Every release may be composed of numerous builds, any one of which might include database changes.  All database changes are included in a single script for any given version.    This approach to versioning results in difficulty supporting upgrades from Betas to RCs to final release. Also, this script versioning scheme often results in merge conflicts as numerous developers need to edit a common script file.  These merge conflicts complicate accepting community pull requests and in rolling back changes when necessary.    h2. Card  As a developer I want to create a uniquely named database script file for every Pull Request.  The system should automatically apply scripts based on the version number and order number specified in the script name.  Scripts should follow the following naming convention: {Version}.{Order}.sqldataprovider where the {Version} token uses the standard DNN version number and the {Order} token is a simple integer with no padding characters (e.g. 01.02.03.4.sqldataprovider)    h2.

When login from child site, cookies will save as local cookie and have expire date;  2.      When login from parent site, cookies will save as session cookie.    In this case, if you both open child site and parent site in different tabs in same browser, and when authentication timeout reached(in web.config, forms node, timeout default value is 60 minutes), membership will try to extend cookie, so that it will create duplicate cookie, you can verify with below steps:  1.

The problem lies here - DNN Platform\Library\Common\Initialize.cs on method InitializeApp()    When they deploy to their test environment, the first URL they call is /install/install.aspx?mode=installresources    Because this is the first page to be executed, The InitializeApp method is called and the IsUpgradeOrInstallRequest method returns true.

When developing a simple MVC module (the one from: http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/155216/module-development-in-dnn-8-1-introduction-to-mvc-modules can be used to reproduce the problem), and trying to add it to a page more than once, nothing happens on sub subsequent module adds.    Steps to reproduce:   1. Install the module   2. Create a new page   3. Click Modules -> Add module   4. Search for the module and drag & drop it on the page   5. Repeat steps 3. and 4. Instead of an additional module nothing happens   6. Delete the module   7. Repeat steps 3. and 4. Module is added.

"DNN-7804","10/23/2015 11:36:25","DCC API - Template Files are stored under Folder Provider but managed as physical files","In the current implementation any content template file is a *.cshtml* file stored inside Portals/X folder (where X is _default for global templates or the ID of the portal for local templates).

This means that depending on the configuration of the folder the templates could be locally in the server file system (standard folder provider), in the database (database folder provider) or even in remote location (i.e.: Azure, Amazon, DropBox folder provider, see Cloud configuration that by default use Azure folder provider).    *Issue*  The current implementation always assumes that these files are stored locally.

Having the template under the Folder Provider could expose several issues:  * We need to add logic into the API to ensure that template are always stored under standard folder provider or investigate if MVC can support read the template file as a stream  * Admin/Content Manager from DAM or Assets could delete those files causing inconsistency unwished issues in the DCC system    *Alternative solution*  We could consider store the templates files under Portals/X-System.  Benefits:  * Admin and Content Managers cannot remove, move these file from DAM or Assets (we have more control over the files to ensure that the system is consistent)  * We always ensure that the files are locally stored and accessible via the Server File System    *Drawbacks*:  * We need change the database ContentTypes_Templates table as currently the reference to the template is stored using the FileId  * Admin couldn’t edit / replace these file from DAM  ",5

"DNN-8141","12/15/2015 19:46:06","Implement Moniker API for Service Framework ","A moniker is a simple name provided for an objects that simplifies identifying specific object instances.  This concept was first used in Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and the Component Object Model (COM).      The DNN Services Framework was first introduced in DNN 6.2.  When creating web services with the Service Framework, it is common to require callers to provide the ModuleId and TabId as part of the web request header.  This requirement complicates the programming model since service endpoints become tied to their specific location in a website.  Modules are able to easily retrieve the ModuleId and TabId from the service framework as part of the initial module rendering.  However, this mechanism is not available for remote callers, where the UI rendering is not directly controlled by DNN.    In order to encapsulate this context data and to simplify the programming model for web services, we should introduce the concept of a moniker.  The DNN service moniker will provide a mechanism for mapping a simple name to a specific module instance.  This moniker can then be passed to a web service in place of the ModuleId, TabId or any other context data specific to a module.    The moniker should be implemented as an additional system TabModule setting. By default, the moniker will be composed of the page name, the module definition friendly name and the TabModuleId separated by /.  When composing the default moniker, all spaces should be replaced with dashes.  For example, if the Social Groups module was on the “Community” page with TabModuleId of 100, the default moniker would be “Community/Social-Groups/100”.      The default moniker implementation provides a human friendly method to identify the page and module being addressed and also a unique element to differentiate between multiple modules on the same page.  The core platform should expose a service endpoint that allows an application to query for monikers related to a specific module type that the current user has permissions to view.    When calling service endpoints that need a specific module context, the moniker will be included as part of the service call.  The service can then use the moniker to easily lookup any context for the module instance associated with the moniker.    *Developer Notes:*  The purpose of this step is to help the back-end to create the DNN context for the web API request. Therefore, it is not tied to any authentication mechanism (like JWT, Basic, Forms, etc.)    Injecting the moniker in the query part of the API request requires modifying all existing API’s that need to use this moniker  but is not feasible and requires making changes to existing core (which we want to completely avoid). What we need is a non-invasive method. One way in which this can be implemented is by adding a new vendor specific header in the request as an alternate way to using the {{TabID}} and {{ModuleID}} that are in use today. Assume we are going to use {{X-DNN-MONIKER}} for this purpose. An example of a full header would be:  {{X-DNN-MONIKER: John’s Blog}}    Before being able to use this feature, there is a need for an API that returns the various monikers associated with a specific module. Let’s say in an EVOQ Engage site if we need to find all the monikers that use the discussions module, say discussions (i.e., all tabs/pages that have the discussions module in them), we will send an API request that returns all of these monikers associated with discussion modules placed on various pages. This call may return zero, one, or more monikers.    There must be a consideration for user rights in every data returned from the API; no private data should be revealed to an un-authorized user.",3

BUT there is a solution: if we deploy the built PDB files from visual studio together with the .DLL files, then the error messages include exact line numbers. This is very helpful in fixing issues.     PDB files have no security implication, they are like JS-map files and only help the error-system inform the user about the code-line where something happened.     Because of this, it's important that we can also include the PDB files in the installation. Unfortunately as of now, the installer blocks this extension - telling the user it's unsafe.     We should add pdb-files to the list of allowed files in the assembly installer to aid in better user error-feedback.

The site also has the DNN Account Login module placed on each page of the website for users to login. When a user is logged in, the user is immediately 302 redirected to the URL specified in the ReturnUrl parameter. This behavior breaks any module that utilizes the ReturnUrl feature of DNN.    In versions prior to DNN v8 (e.g. v7.4.2), authenticated users were not redirected when the Account login module is on a page and the URL included a ReturnUrl parameter.    I am aware that the LOGIN skin object can create the login link to open the popup window or take the user to the login page, but the Account Login module should be able to be placed on a page without affecting the flow. The RedirectUrl parameter should only be followed during an actual successful authentication, not because the page it is on just happens to have a RedirectUrl parameter.    QA need to pick up build less than 9.2.0.301 though it is present since 8.0.1, and issue is about having Account Login Module in a page for logged in user, if on such page returnurl is present then application was redirecting it to that page, which is not desirable.    +Steps to reproduce:+    1. After login as host, add two pages one with all (PageAllWithAccountModule) and other is registered users permission (restricted)  2. In edit mode, Add Account Login Module on PageAllWithAccountModule, then exit from EDIT MODE.  3. You should be on that page then your URL will be  http://yousitename/PageAllWithAccountModule  4. Now add returnurl in the above URL and enter, like this http://yousitename/PageWithAccountModule?returnurl=restricted    Expected:  It should be on same page with URL, should not follow returnurl   http://yousitename/PageWithAccountModule?returnurl=restricted     Result:  It is redirecting to restricted page   http://yousitename/restricted     However if user is not logged in and he tries to access http://{yousitename}/restricted, then he would see redirected url like this  http://yousitename/Login?returnurl=%2frestricted  And upon logging in he should be redirected restricted page with URL  http://yousitename/restricted    So, in brief returnurl should only work if user is not logged in, if logged-in then not",2

However their code is not working since DNN is partially locking the user before they reach the max attempts.    *Here is their comment:*  DNN is partially locking out the borrower on the 5th attempt(default without the maxInvalidPasswordAttempts). If I set the maxInvalidPasswordAttempts to 4 it still only partially locks the user on the 4th attempt.    If you try to programmatically ResetPassword there is an exception that the user is locked out, but when you look at the account IN DNN the account does not say that it is locked out and has a strange Last Lockout Date in the Database. In addition if you programmatically look at Membership.LockedOut for that user it shows false. It’s not until the user tries the next attempt at a password and fails does it FULLY get locked out.    In your sample of changing it to 4. Try to login 4 times only with the wrong password. Then login as an admin and look at the account. It does not show as being locked out…until you update that account or they try on the 5th attempt.    *We have a function that allows our staff to programmatically ResetPassword. This fails because they are partially locked out*. In the code we check the Membership.LockedOut. If it is true then we unlock the user before the ResetPassword. If it is false we do not unlock the user. In this case it showing false so the unlock code is skipped, and the ResetPassword is attempted and gets an exception because the it says that the user is locked out. Seems to me that there is a flaw in the DNN code that sets the user as locked out or the Membership.LockedOut is showing an incorrect status(false when it should be true).    *Here is a snippet of that code:*    Dim dnnUser As Entities.Users.UserInfo = MembershipProvider.Instance.GetUserByUserName(PortalId, ltUserName.Text)    Dim aspUser As MembershipUser = System.Web.Security.Membership.Providers(""AspNetSqlMembershipProviderAdmin"").GetUser(ltUserName.Text, False)    If dnnUser.Membership.LockedOut Then    MembershipProvider.Instance.UnLockUser(dnnUser)    End If    Dim newPassword As String = aspUser.ResetPassword()    The LockedOut is False and the ResetPassword throws an exception that says it is locked out.

The window 'load' event form has been removed in jQuery 3 and all $(window).load(function () {}) calls should be replaced with $(window).on('load', function(){}) event binding calls instead.

Root of the problem lies when you configure Member Directory module to filter users/members by Group. And you select an appropriate group from the list.    That works fine for the group you've selected. But as soon as you try to view a list of members of any other group you get a list of members for the group you initially configured because thats the group reference that is stored as [FilterValue] in [ModuleSettings] table.    OK, I won't go into an argument that there is supposed to be logic to look for query string parameter [groupid] which then used to filter out users because that is true. But there lies our problem.
