In DNN6 this could be done using a special skin, but, in 7, the command bar is injected at the top of the page and so the skin approach doesn&apos;t work.   The procedure that injects the command bar is in Skin.cs. Before doing so, it evaluates two querystring parameters - popup and dnnprintmode.

"DNN-26810","05/31/2013 05:52:00",3,"Save / Restore Module with Settings + Content Problem: Often modules have more content in the ""settings"" than in ""content"". I have for example an HTML module with a lot of javascript in the head section of the settings and only one simple canvas element in the content. Exporting content only exports the canvas and nothing else. Solution: DNN has internal methods for saving a complete page or even a complete website as a template, with all settings. But when exporting and importing module content, these methods are not used. Instead there is a special solution for this which only fetches the content and nothing else. Attachment: I attached 3 changed files of the core which changes this behaviour to the standard DNN way and allows to export and import a module with all the settings. There are only minor changes in codebehind of export.ascx and import.ascx and 1 new method in ModuleController.cs. If an old template is selected for import, import goes the old way and a new template imports the whole thing with settings and permissions Enhancements: I did not change the UI of import.ascx. Perhaps it would be a great enhancement to add some checkboxes like: Include Settings, Include Content, Include Permissions. If IncludeContent is checked by default and the others not this is the behaviour like before. You could easy add these values as parameters to the new Method in ModuleController and add some ""if""-statements.","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DNN-3371","08/16/2013 00:27:13",8,"Search > Journal Crawler (mini spike) Currently the Site Crawler in the Platform does not crawl Journal items. Journal integration with Search is a bit tricky as Journal has a different permission system as compared with module / tab permissions. There are two ways this integration can be done:    *Treat Journal as Module and implement ModuleSearchBase*    1) The advantage of this approach is that all you need to implement is ModuleSearchBase and the content will start to get indexed by Site Crawler.  2) However, there is a downside that Journal has a different permission system then typical module / tab permission. During indexing, one would need to translate Journal’s permission into module type permission so Search can do security trimming.    *New Crawler - Create a new SearchType for Journal*    1) This approach allows checking of Journal permission at querying time.  2) This SearchType should implement BaseResultController, especially the HasViewPermission method. GetDocUrl method in this method is marked as abstract, but isn't called if Url is already stored in the SearchDocument.  3) There is no need to create a separate scheduled tasked. All we need to do is modify Site Crawler to call into Journal to obtain SearchDocuments. Site Crawler currently crawls through tab and module metadata and collects SearchDocuments from modules that implement ISearchable or ModuleSearchBase.   4) When user performs a query and hits are found in Journal, system will call HasViewPermission method every hit in Lucene. This will require a DB hit to check permission, which is a down-side.   5) Make sure the SearchType is not marked as Private.  In reality 90% of Journal entries are Public (except for ones in a Social Group), a mixed approach can be done, where permission is stored in the Index for all the public items so there isn’t a hit.    *Due to the above I call this as a mini-spike*  ","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DNN-3754","09/05/2013 00:58:25",1,"SI: Redirect after registration not working Description - Customer has provided us with a bug that they found. Customers email following:    The logic in the if...else code block that checks if a Redirect_AfterRegistration page was set in Portal Settings, and sets the RedirectURL accordingly, is backwards. If a redirect page was set, the value of the    ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"" portal setting returned is a positive integer value corresponding to the TabID of the page the new user should be redirected to after registration. If no page was set, or if the Administrator manually selects    ""<None Specified>"" for this setting, then the value returned is -1. Therefore, the logic in this code block (as currently shipped in version 7.1.1) is backwards and results in new users being redirected incorrectly after registering on    the site.    When the logic checks if the setting is > 0, it should redirect to the URL of the TabID set for the after registration page. Otherwise, if a positive value was not returned (ie. no redirect after registration page was set), it should    then begin the code block to check for the returnurl parameter value (if sent in querystring), or remain on the same page if no returnurl parameter value was specified. The current code's logic blocks need flip flopped to work as    designed.    STEPS TO REPRODUCE:    1. In Site Settings > User Account Settings > Registration Settings, set the User Registration type to ""Public"", Registration Form Type to ""Standard"", and set Redirect After Registration dropdown to any page (except the Home or Getting    Started pages) that is viewable by Registered Users. Be sure to Save settings.  2. If it is not already set, temporarily set View permissions on the Getting Started page to allow viewing by Registered Users.  3. Logout.  4. Navigate to registration page with a manually set ""returnurl"" parameter value in the querystring that would return you to the Getting Started page, as such: /?ctl=register&returnurl=%2fGettingStarted.aspx  5. Fill out the registration form as a new user and click ""Register"".  6. Note that instead of being redirected to the page you selected in the Redirect After Registration settings dropdown (which is where you should have been redirected to), you are redirected to the Getting Started page, which was passed    as the returnurl parameter value in querystring.    (NOTE: If you do not select a page for Redirect After Registration in the Site Settings, then you are always redirected to 404 or Home page (relative url path = ""/"") regardless of value for returnurl parameter. The reversed logic sees    that the value is not > 0, so in the else, it tries to redirect you to page with ID of the returned setting value (which in the case where none was set, the returned value is -1). There is no page found with ID = -1 when NavigateURL    tries to resolve it.)    CURRENT CODE (BUG is found in Lines 138-166 of \DesktopModules\Admin\Security\Register.ascx.cs):      protected string RedirectURL  {  get  {  string _RedirectURL = """";    object setting = GetSetting(PortalId, ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"");    if (Convert.ToInt32(setting) > 0)  {  if (Request.QueryString[""returnurl""] != null)  {  //return to the url passed to register  _RedirectURL = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString[""returnurl""]);  //redirect url should never contain a protocol ( if it does, it is likely a cross-site request forgery attempt )  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""://""))  {  _RedirectURL = """";  }  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""?returnurl""))  {  string baseURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(0, _RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal));  string returnURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(_RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal) + 11);    _RedirectURL = string.Concat(baseURL, ""?returnurl"", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(returnURL));  }  }  if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(_RedirectURL))  {  //redirect to current page  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL();  }  }  else //redirect to after registration page  {  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL(Convert.ToInt32(setting));  }  return _RedirectURL;  }  }    CODE FIX (Reversing the conditional logic Code Blocks resolves this bug and the New User is redirected correctly after registering.):      protected string RedirectURL  {  get  {  string _RedirectURL = """";    object setting = GetSetting(PortalId, ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"");    if (Convert.ToInt32(setting) > 0) //redirect to after registration page  {  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL(Convert.ToInt32(setting));  }  else  {  if (Request.QueryString[""returnurl""] != null)  {  //return to the url passed to register  _RedirectURL = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString[""returnurl""]);  //redirect url should never contain a protocol ( if it does, it is likely a cross-site request forgery attempt )  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""://""))  {  _RedirectURL = """";  }  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""?returnurl""))  {  string baseURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(0, _RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal));  string returnURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(_RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal) + 11);    _RedirectURL = string.Concat(baseURL, ""?returnurl"", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(returnURL));  }  }  if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(_RedirectURL))  {  //redirect to current page  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL();  }    }  return _RedirectURL;  }  }","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Replace this (this first one probably isn't used in IIS 7+ websites, but if your web.config has it, change it)    <add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""iFinity.DNN.Modules.FriendlyUrl.UrlRewriteModule, iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider"" />    with this    <add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""DotNetNuke.HttpModules.UrlRewriteModule, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" />    and replace this    <add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""iFinity.DNN.Modules.FriendlyUrl.UrlRewriteModule, iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider"" preCondition=""managedHandler"" />    with this    <add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""DotNetNuke.HttpModules.UrlRewriteModule, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" preCondition=""managedHandler"" />    Then finally your friendlyUrl section of the web.config should most likely look like this       <friendlyUrl defaultProvider=""DNNFriendlyUrl"">      <providers>          <clear />           <add name=""DNNFriendlyUrl"" type=""DotNetNuke.Services.Url.FriendlyUrl.DNNFriendlyUrlProvider, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" includePageName=""true"" regexMatch=""[^a-zA-Z0-9 _-]"" urlFormat=""Advanced"" />      </providers>  </friendlyUrl>","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This would look something like this:      However, there is a null reference exception that occurs when the {{ConfigInstaller}} tries to commit the change.  This is because the installer is trying to reference {{TargetFile.FullName}}, but {{TargetFile}} is only set when the {{fileName}} attribute _isn't_ set on the component.    The simple fix would be to check whether {{TargetFile}} is {{null}}.  But this overlooks the bigger issue, which is that when the XML Merge script is in a different file, the changes in it are applied directly to the target file (e.g. web.config).  This is in contrast to when the XML Merge script is included inline (and to components of other types) which apply changes to temporary files and then commit once the changes are verified as successful.    So, in this case where the installation fails because of the null reference exception, those XML Merge changes to the web.config are still applied to the site, and not rolled back, because they took place against the site's web.config already, before the Commit stage.","  <component type=""Config"" fileName=""Install.xml"" unInstallFileName=""Uninstall.xml"" />  ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DNN-4029","11/01/2013 00:06:56",1,"SI: UsersOnline throwing caching exception UsersOnline is throwing a caching exception, which was explained by Bruce as follows:    It literally means that a collection was changed (items added, removed or collection cleared) while another thread was doing an enumeration on the object.  The collection is no longer in the state expected during the enumeration process and so the exception is thrown.    However, why this is….  It could either be a bug in that a collection is being accessed by multiple threads without a thread lock (all generic collections in c# are not thread safe and require locking to be implemented by the developer) – or it could be something else within the caching provider.    The first place to look is in the UserOnlineController.SetUserList function – when and where this is called and if it could lead to a thread unsafe operation.    exception:    2013-10-31 02:30:00,567 [RD00155D4440AF][Thread:65][FATAL] DotNetNuke.Web.Common.Internal.DotNetNukeHttpApplication - System.InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.     at System.Collections.Hashtable.GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.WriteObjectInfo.InitSerialize(Object obj, ISurrogateSelector surrogateSelector, StreamingContext context, SerObjectInfoInit serObjectInfoInit, IFormatterConverter converter, ObjectWriter objectWriter, SerializationBinder binder)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.WriteObjectInfo.Serialize(Object obj, ISurrogateSelector surrogateSelector, StreamingContext context, SerObjectInfoInit serObjectInfoInit, IFormatterConverter converter, ObjectWriter objectWriter, SerializationBinder binder)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.ObjectWriter.Serialize(Object graph, Header[] inHeaders, __BinaryWriter serWriter, Boolean fCheck)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter.Serialize(Stream serializationStream, Object graph, Header[] headers, Boolean fCheck)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter.Serialize(Stream serializationStream, Object graph, Header[] headers)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCacheObjectSerializationProvider.SerializeUserObject(Object userObject, Boolean isCompressionEnabled, ValueFlagsVersion flagsType)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.SocketClientProtocol.Upsert(VelocityPacketType type, String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.SocketClientProtocol.Put(String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.InternalPut(String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.<>c__DisplayClass4a.<Put>b__49()     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.Put(String key, Object value, TimeSpan timeout, IEnumerable`1 tags, String region)     at DotNetNuke.Providers.CachingProviders.AzureCachingProvider.AzureCachingProvider.Put(String cacheKey, Object itemToCache, DateTime absoluteExpiration, TimeSpan slidingExpiration)     at DotNetNuke.Providers.CachingProviders.AzureCachingProvider.AzureCachingProvider.Insert(String cacheKey, Object itemToCache, DNNCacheDependency dependency, DateTime absoluteExpiration, TimeSpan slidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority priority, CacheItemRemovedCallback onRemoveCallback)     at DotNetNuke.Common.Utilities.DataCache.SetCache(String CacheKey, Object objObject, DNNCacheDependency objDependency, DateTime AbsoluteExpiration, TimeSpan SlidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority Priority, CacheItemRemovedCallback OnRemoveCallback)     at DotNetNuke.Entities.Users.UserOnlineController.SetUserList(Hashtable userList)     at DotNetNuke.Entities.Users.UserOnlineController.TrackAuthenticatedUser(HttpContext context)     at System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute()     at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean& completedSynchronously)  ","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(DNN version 6.2.5). The problem did not manifest itself on our single core test-environment, nor in our development environments. There also seemed to be no relation between any particular request and the probability of the problem occurring.    I made dumps using DebugDiag and the (32 bit version of) taskmanager. Analyses of the dumps with WinDbg  showed all of the runaway threads busy with an Insert call on a generic dictionary in the UserController.GetCachedUser method.    This method indeed gets a dictionary from the cache and sets a value on it. The dictionary is a common generic dictionary, not thread-safe. However the object is shared among threads through the cache, and thus a thread-safe dictionary should be used.    I have fixed this by changing line 242 in method UserController.GetUserLookupDictionary so that the CBO.GetCachedObject overload with the saveInDictionary parameter is used, having set the saveInDictionary  parameter to true.    I have attached the fixed version of UserController.cs. See lines 242-251    This bug probably also affects all 7+ versions and earlier 6.. versions. because the offending methods have not been changed.    So far, the high CPU problem has not returned in the past 24 hours. Before the fix, the problem would manifest itself one or more times per hour.

"DNN-4664","01/15/2014 03:40:44",8,"Allow 404 Exception Bubbling from Modules This item relates to the ability for a third-party module to raise a 404 and have the standard DNN 404 handler catch and handle it.    The DNN 404 handler does the following things:  1) logs the 404 to a special 404 exception type  2) shows the portal-specific 404 page  3) sends back a 'true' 404 status code, instead of the asp.net standard of generating a 302 redirect to an error page.    When module developers wish to intentionally throw a 404 error in their code (such as when a wrong-for-the-module URL is requested, such as a non-existent blog post), they cannot currently get the DNN 404 handler to deal with this.  This is because the general-exception handling catches any raised 404 exception, and turns it over to the general exception handling behaviour, which is to show an error page.    The requirements for this change are to:  1) Allow a module developer to raise a 404 exception in their module code  2) Have an unhandled 404 exception bubble up until it is in the main DNN Exception handling code (for the page lifecycle)  3) Have 404 exceptions passed-through as a special case to the URL Rewriting 404 Handling code, so that it will return a 404 status code and show the portal-specific 404 page.    Test Case  -------------  For the test case, a module will have to be built which has a simple way of generating a 404.  This is suggested to be a simple module with a view control that returns a 404 if you reuqest a set URL (ie /status/404) for the page the module exists on.  This module should be built as part of making the change and provided to the QA team.   The module should also have a way of generating a 'generic' 500 exception, to show that the normal exception handling is not affected (ie /status/500)    Step 1 : Verify that 404 handling is working as expected (example.com/junkurl)  Step 2 : Install the exception-testing module  Step 3 : Request a 404 Exception    -Expected Result-  Shows the same 404 page as Step 1    Step 4: Request a 500 Exception  -Expected Result-  Shows the DNN error page, and not the 404 page.","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This involved many facets including reducing viewstate, pagesize and removing unnecessary script registration. As part of this work jquery-migrate was no longer registered for a default anonymous page viewer as it was not needed - however post 7.3.0's release it became apparent that some skin and module developers were relying on jquery-migrate being registered (rather than registering it within their skin/module). Whilst this is easily fixed by adding the relevant registration (or using the jquery skin object), we decided to add a registration for jquery-migrate to help with sites running skins/modules that relied on this dependency (i.e. existing users would not need to get updated versions of their components).

"DNN-5613","07/15/2014 19:06:56",2,"SI: Problem with Module Controller and 17k value Customer has reported a bug that is present in the Core DNN API which affects the module settings table when a character of size 17k is added to the column SettingValue.    From Customer:     Here is a screencast of the bug happening and being debugged in DNN's code:  http://screencast.com/t/PcaQrv6W  We've investigated this method (UpdateModuleSettingInternal) further and we have found what is the problem.  ModuleController.cs line 685  The method uses a datareader in order to determine if a setting already exists in the ModuleSettings table and add or update the setting as it is appropriate. This is a VERY bad idea, DataReaders keep their connection with the tables they use open while they themselves are not closed, at least partially. You can imagine that trying to update a table that is being kept open milliseconds before can eventually result in a deadlock. That is what is happening in this case.  When the datareader reads the 17Kb Lorem ipsum that was already uploaded to ModuleSettings, the table gets locked, so when the code gets to ""dataProvider.UpdateModuleSetting(moduleId, settingName, settingValue, UserController.Instance.GetCurrentUserInfo().UserID);"" and calls the SP that updates ModuleSettings, the SP hangs when trying to update the table.  Since the data we where modifying in the table was already there, we commented in UpdateModuleSettingInternal all that had to do with the datareader and AddModuleSetting. This made the code work flawlessly every time instead of hanging every time.  Possible solution for this: My approach would be something like removing the datareader, and instead checking for an existing row at stored procedure level. The ""If exists"" statement has a better performance and has the perk of not locking the table after it has run. Then, in case the row exists, insert or update as needed.  Of course, this is just a suggestion, but bear in mind that since the column SettingValue is nvarchar(max), large values are not beyond the scope of what could happen (and we have proved it happened in one of our clients).  We just wanted to let you know of the problem and a possible fix. Let me know if I can be of any futher help with this issue.      Please see attached ticket for more details on this issue.

The enhancement proposal is to add a flag to the NotificationType table, to specify if the notification should be displayed in the task list:  - The logic in Social_cmx_GetTasks SPROC will be simplified  - The default value should be false (each notification type needs to be updated in Content/Social to set this to true; taking into consideration upgrades vs. new installations)  - This column, IsTask, should be created via the Platform as a bit column and have all values set to 0 (false) then add a constraint for NOT NULL.   - The API that exists today (for creating notification types) should create an overload method passing a default value of 0 (and also mark existing method as obsolete; only required if the method today is parameterized)    Note: The solution here must work for both Content & Social.

"DNN-6919","04/28/2015 03:14:50",3,"Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release DNN upgrades are based on a 3 part version number representing the platform, major and minor version numbers.  Each version component uses a 2 digit integer with a leading zero for padding (e.g. 01.02.03).  This version number uniquely identifies a release and is used as an identifier when creating database upgrade scripts.  Every release may be composed of numerous builds, any one of which might include database changes.  All database changes are included in a single script for any given version.    This approach to versioning results in difficulty supporting upgrades from Betas to RCs to final release. Also, this script versioning scheme often results in merge conflicts as numerous developers need to edit a common script file.  These merge conflicts complicate accepting community pull requests and in rolling back changes when necessary.    h2. Card  As a developer I want to create a uniquely named database script file for every Pull Request.  The system should automatically apply scripts based on the version number and order number specified in the script name.

"DNN-6946","04/30/2015 21:27:52",3," SafeDirectoryCatalog takes a long time at DNN Startup Because of quite recent changes I believe, DotNetNuke.ExtensionPoints.ExtensionPointManager's initialization at DNN startup creates an instance of  DotNetNuke.ExtensionPoints.SafeDirectoryCatalog, which in turns triggers a complete Reflection analysis of all assemblies included in the bin folder, including fields and methods, which doubles our starting time in one of our instance.    Is that complete analysis necessary that early?    One reason for the initial trigger is to filter out assemblies that won't load properly as can be read in the class.   Attached is a modification where a list of such faulty assemblies is computed to a file to avoid that check on each startup, but the catalog is further parsed when parts are later composed in the code, so the performance gain is only from not throwing unnecessary exceptions, which is negligible.    However, it might be that similar fixes could save from a complete analysis on startup.","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When login from child site, cookies will save as local cookie and have expire date;  2.      When login from parent site, cookies will save as session cookie.    In this case, if you both open child site and parent site in different tabs in same browser, and when authentication timeout reached(in web.config, forms node, timeout default value is 60 minutes), membership will try to extend cookie, so that it will create duplicate cookie, you can verify with below steps:  1.      Change web.config, set timeout to 3, so no need wait for a long time;  2.      Open child site and login as host;  3.      Open parent site in another tab in same browser, now it should also already login;  4.      And wait for 5 minutes, then check cookies, you will see 2 cookies.    so we need notice that when create site groups, we need avoid that cookie name may shares with sites which not in site group, and IMO no need code fix for this problem, the  workaround is just close browser and open again.

The site is load balanced over 4 web servers in our test environment but the web farm is disabled.    Even with a single entry in the WebServers table however, the problem still exists.    Looking closely at Source Code, the real reason for the problem was discovered.    The problem lies here - DNN Platform\Library\Common\Initialize.cs on method InitializeApp()    When they deploy to their test environment, the first URL they call is /install/install.aspx?mode=installresources    Because this is the first page to be executed, The InitializeApp method is called and the IsUpgradeOrInstallRequest method returns true.    Crucially, because of this - the Globals.IISAppName is not set.    When the install process then attempts to send a cache clear message, this line below in the WebRequestCachingProvider throws the exception as discussed.    var thisServer = ServerController.GetServers().Single(s => s.ServerName == Globals.ServerName && s.IISAppName == Globals.IISAppName);    They have made a change in our version of the initialize method to always set the Globals.IISAppName and this has resolved the issue for them.

When developing a simple MVC module (the one from: http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/155216/module-development-in-dnn-8-1-introduction-to-mvc-modules can be used to reproduce the problem), and trying to add it to a page more than once, nothing happens on sub subsequent module adds.

"DNN-7804","10/23/2015 11:36:25",5,"DCC API - Template Files are stored under Folder Provider but managed as physical files In the current implementation any content template file is a *.cshtml* file stored inside Portals/X folder (where X is _default for global templates or the ID of the portal for local templates).   This space is managed by the DNN Folder Provider system. This means that depending on the configuration of the folder the templates could be locally in the server file system (standard folder provider), in the database (database folder provider) or even in remote location (i.e.: Azure, Amazon, DropBox folder provider, see Cloud configuration that by default use Azure folder provider).    *Issue*  The current implementation always assumes that these files are stored locally. See GetTemplateName method in the Dnn.Modules.DynamicContentViewer.Controllers.ViewController class        This latter assumption seems related to how the current DCC Module MVC implementation works that need to be able to reach the template file physically in the file system:      We probably need to discuss more this part. Having the template under the Folder Provider could expose several issues:  * We need to add logic into the API to ensure that template are always stored under standard folder provider or investigate if MVC can support read the template file as a stream  * Admin/Content Manager from DAM or Assets could delete those files causing inconsistency unwished issues in the DCC system    *Alternative solution*  We could consider store the templates files under Portals/X-System.  Benefits:  * Admin and Content Managers cannot remove, move these file from DAM or Assets (we have more control over the files to ensure that the system is consistent)  * We always ensure that the files are locally stored and accessible via the Server File System    *Drawbacks*:  * We need change the database ContentTypes_Templates table as currently the reference to the template is stored using the FileId  * Admin couldn’t edit / replace these file from DAM  ","  private string GetTemplateName(ContentTemplate template)          {              string templateName = String.Empty;              IFileInfo file = null;              if (template != null)              {                  file = FileManager.Instance.GetFile(template.TemplateFileId);              }                 if (file != null)              {                  if (file.PortalId > -1)                  {                      templateName = PortalSettings.HomeDirectory + file.RelativePath;                  }                  else                  {                      templateName = Globals.HostPath + file.RelativePath;                  }              }              return templateName;          }    private static string ExecuteTemplate(DnnHelper dnnHelper, string dataType, string template, ViewDataDictionary viewData)          {              var actionCache = GetActionCache(dnnHelper);              var viewContext = dnnHelper.ViewContext;                 ViewEngineResult viewEngineResult = ViewEngines.Engines.FindPartialView(dnnHelper.ViewContext, template);              if (viewEngineResult.View != null)              {  ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DNN-7812","10/26/2015 09:49:20",3,"Redirect to Login page fails when accessing a page with permission ""Registered users"" in a multi-language portal when navigating with the second languge Brief Description of Issue.  When accessing a page with permission ""Registered users"" of a multi-language portal using the second language (that is different from the default one), the user is redirected to the home page of the default language instead of the login page of the current language.    Steps to reproduce the issue.  1: Install a DNN 7.4.2. blank website in English (United States).  2: Add a second language (ie. it-IT).  3: Enable ""Allow Content Localization"" in Host > Host settings > Other settings.  4: In Admin > Languages press button ""Enable Localized Content"". In the opened popup window set ""Make all pages Translatable"" (English - United States will be set as Current Site Default) and press ""Enable Localized Content"".  5: In Admin > Languages set ""Enabled"" check box of the added second language in ""Enabled"" column.  6: In Admin > Languages click on the icon ""Create pages in this language"" in ""Pages"" column.  7: In Admin > Languages click on ""Active"" check box in ""Active"" column.  8: Translate and publish the home page of the second language  9: In English - United State language, add a Login page. Add ""Account login"" module to this page. Set page permission to ""All users"" for this page.   10: In second language, copy ""Account login"" module, translate and publish the Login page.  11: Set the Login page for both languages in Admin > Site settings > Advanced settings.  12: In English - United State language, add a new page (ie. ""Reserved page""). Set page permission to ""Registerd Users"".  13: In second language, translate (ie. ""Pagina riservata) and publish the page added in step 12.  14: Switch to the home page of second language and try to access the page added in step 13 (ie. /it-it/Pagina-riservata) as a not logged in user.    Actual result:  Redirection to the home page of the default language (ie. /en-us)    Expected result:  Redirection to the login page of the current laguage (ie. /it-it/login?returnurl=/it-it/Pagina-riservata)    ---- Possible Solution (as far is my understanding of the platform and multi-language)  The offending code is located at line 515 of file DNN_Platform_07.04.02_Source\DNN Platform\Library\UI\Skins\Skin.cs where the DefaultLocale is used in a multilanguage portal instead of the Current Locale.  The outcome is that even if the redirectUrl is correctly defined, the following if will always fail when navigating the site in the second language thus overwriting the redirectUrl with the home page of the default langugage.    if (TabPermissionController.CanViewPage())  {   ...  }  else  {   //If request localized page which haven't complete translate yet, redirect to default language version.   var redirectUrl = Globals.AccessDeniedURL(Localization.GetString(""TabAccess.Error""));   Locale defaultLocale = LocaleController.Instance.GetDefaultLocale(PortalSettings.PortalId);   if (PortalSettings.ContentLocalizationEnabled &&    TabController.CurrentPage.CultureCode != defaultLocale.Code)   {    redirectUrl = new LanguageTokenReplace {Language = defaultLocale.Code}.ReplaceEnvironmentTokens(""[URL]"");   }     Response.Redirect(redirectUrl, true);  }    Proposed fix should affect lines 515-520 as follow:    //If request localized page which haven't complete translate yet, redirect to default language version.  var redirectUrl = Globals.AccessDeniedURL(Localization.GetString(""TabAccess.Error""));  Locale currentLocale = LocaleController.Instance.GetCurrentLocale(PortalSettings.PortalId);  if (PortalSettings.ContentLocalizationEnabled &&   TabController.CurrentPage.CultureCode != currentLocale.Code)  {   redirectUrl = new LanguageTokenReplace {Language = currentLocale.Code}.ReplaceEnvironmentTokens(""[URL]"");  }  ","",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DNN-8141","12/15/2015 19:46:06",3,"Implement Moniker API for Service Framework  A moniker is a simple name provided for an objects that simplifies identifying specific object instances.  This concept was first used in Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and the Component Object Model (COM).      The DNN Services Framework was first introduced in DNN 6.2.  When creating web services with the Service Framework, it is common to require callers to provide the ModuleId and TabId as part of the web request header.  This requirement complicates the programming model since service endpoints become tied to their specific location in a website.  Modules are able to easily retrieve the ModuleId and TabId from the service framework as part of the initial module rendering.  However, this mechanism is not available for remote callers, where the UI rendering is not directly controlled by DNN.    In order to encapsulate this context data and to simplify the programming model for web services, we should introduce the concept of a moniker.  The DNN service moniker will provide a mechanism for mapping a simple name to a specific module instance.  This moniker can then be passed to a web service in place of the ModuleId, TabId or any other context data specific to a module.    The moniker should be implemented as an additional system TabModule setting. By default, the moniker will be composed of the page name, the module definition friendly name and the TabModuleId separated by /.  When composing the default moniker, all spaces should be replaced with dashes.  For example, if the Social Groups module was on the “Community” page with TabModuleId of 100, the default moniker would be “Community/Social-Groups/100”.      The default moniker implementation provides a human friendly method to identify the page and module being addressed and also a unique element to differentiate between multiple modules on the same page.  The core platform should expose a service endpoint that allows an application to query for monikers related to a specific module type that the current user has permissions to view.    When calling service endpoints that need a specific module context, the moniker will be included as part of the service call.  The service can then use the moniker to easily lookup any context for the module instance associated with the moniker.    *Developer Notes:*  The purpose of this step is to help the back-end to create the DNN context for the web API request. Therefore, it is not tied to any authentication mechanism (like JWT, Basic, Forms, etc.)    Injecting the moniker in the query part of the API request requires modifying all existing API’s that need to use this moniker  but is not feasible and requires making changes to existing core (which we want to completely avoid). What we need is a non-invasive method. One way in which this can be implemented is by adding a new vendor specific header in the request as an alternate way to using the {{TabID}} and {{ModuleID}} that are in use today. Assume we are going to use {{X-DNN-MONIKER}} for this purpose. An example of a full header would be:  {{X-DNN-MONIKER: John’s Blog}}    Before being able to use this feature, there is a need for an API that returns the various monikers associated with a specific module. Let’s say in an EVOQ Engage site if we need to find all the monikers that use the discussions module, say discussions (i.e., all tabs/pages that have the discussions module in them), we will send an API request that returns all of these monikers associated with discussion modules placed on various pages. This call may return zero, one, or more monikers.    There must be a consideration for user rights in every data returned from the API; no private data should be revealed to an un-authorized user.","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The site also has the DNN Account Login module placed on each page of the website for users to login. When a user is logged in, the user is immediately 302 redirected to the URL specified in the ReturnUrl parameter. This behavior breaks any module that utilizes the ReturnUrl feature of DNN.    In versions prior to DNN v8 (e.g. v7.4.2), authenticated users were not redirected when the Account login module is on a page and the URL included a ReturnUrl parameter.    I am aware that the LOGIN skin object can create the login link to open the popup window or take the user to the login page, but the Account Login module should be able to be placed on a page without affecting the flow. The RedirectUrl parameter should only be followed during an actual successful authentication, not because the page it is on just happens to have a RedirectUrl parameter.    QA need to pick up build less than 9.2.0.301 though it is present since 8.0.1, and issue is about having Account Login Module in a page for logged in user, if on such page returnurl is present then application was redirecting it to that page, which is not desirable.    +Steps to reproduce:+    1.

"DNN-9485","01/06/2017 22:55:22",2,"SI: maxInvalidPasswordAttempts is partially locking user Brief Description of Issue:  User created a function that allows staff to programmatically Reset Password instead of getting locked out. However their code is not working since DNN is partially locking the user before they reach the max attempts.    *Here is their comment:*  DNN is partially locking out the borrower on the 5th attempt(default without the maxInvalidPasswordAttempts). If I set the maxInvalidPasswordAttempts to 4 it still only partially locks the user on the 4th attempt.    If you try to programmatically ResetPassword there is an exception that the user is locked out, but when you look at the account IN DNN the account does not say that it is locked out and has a strange Last Lockout Date in the Database. In addition if you programmatically look at Membership.LockedOut for that user it shows false. It’s not until the user tries the next attempt at a password and fails does it FULLY get locked out.    In your sample of changing it to 4. Try to login 4 times only with the wrong password. Then login as an admin and look at the account. It does not show as being locked out…until you update that account or they try on the 5th attempt.    *We have a function that allows our staff to programmatically ResetPassword. This fails because they are partially locked out*. In the code we check the Membership.LockedOut. If it is true then we unlock the user before the ResetPassword. If it is false we do not unlock the user. In this case it showing false so the unlock code is skipped, and the ResetPassword is attempted and gets an exception because the it says that the user is locked out. Seems to me that there is a flaw in the DNN code that sets the user as locked out or the Membership.LockedOut is showing an incorrect status(false when it should be true).    *Here is a snippet of that code:*    Dim dnnUser As Entities.Users.UserInfo = MembershipProvider.Instance.GetUserByUserName(PortalId, ltUserName.Text)    Dim aspUser As MembershipUser = System.Web.Security.Membership.Providers(""AspNetSqlMembershipProviderAdmin"").GetUser(ltUserName.Text, False)    If dnnUser.Membership.LockedOut Then    MembershipProvider.Instance.UnLockUser(dnnUser)    End If    Dim newPassword As String = aspUser.ResetPassword()    The LockedOut is False and the ResetPassword throws an exception that says it is locked out.    Again this only occurs if the user does not go beyond the maxInvalidPasswordAttempts and calls us to reset their account password.","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Therefore, the FilterTabsByRoles method in the TabsController [Dnn.PersonaBar.Library.Controllers] will not return the tabs that does not match these roles that been called by GetPortalTabs method.   https://local.mantrahotels.com/API/PersonaBar/Tabs/GetPortalTabs?portalId=-2&cultureCode=&isMultiLanguage=false&excludeAdminTabs=false&disabledNotSelectable=false&roles=1%3B-1&sortOrder=0&selectedTabId=-1    On the other hand, the multiple page creation does not pass the roles parameter values and hence it will returns all the tabs except  disabledNotSelectable.   https://local.mantrahotels.com/API/PersonaBar/Tabs/GetPortalTabs?portalId=-2&cultureCode=&isMultiLanguage=false&excludeAdminTabs=false&disabledNotSelectable=false&roles=&sortOrder=0&selectedTabId=-1","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DNN-10599","12/14/2017 20:08:03",1,"Member Directory: Filter By Group not working This is a fairly trivial issue from code mechanics point of view but its a show stopper for us.    Root of the problem lies when you configure Member Directory module to filter users/members by Group. And you select an appropriate group from the list.    That works fine for the group you've selected. But as soon as you try to view a list of members of any other group you get a list of members for the group you initially configured because thats the group reference that is stored as [FilterValue] in [ModuleSettings] table.    OK, I won't go into an argument that there is supposed to be logic to look for query string parameter [groupid] which then used to filter out users because that is true. But there lies our problem.    MemberDirectoryController.cs line 126      Can someone correct this function so I won't have to recompile this module every time.     All that needs to be adjusted is an argument for <int filterRoleId> from <Int32.Parse(filterValue)> to <groupId> in the call to <UserController.Instance.GetUsersAdvancedSearch()> and everyone becomes happy.    I am not sure if this affects earlier versions of DNN (prior to v7.2.2) as I was lazy to check. But I can confirm this issue to be persistent between 7.2.2 right up to 7.3.3.","              IList<UserInfo> users;              switch (filterBy)              {                  case ""Group"":                      if (groupId == -1)                      {                          groupId = Int32.Parse(filterValue);                      }                      if (CanViewGroupMembers(portalId, groupId))                      {                          //users = UserController.Instance.GetUsersAdvancedSearch(portalId, userId, -1,                          //                                                               Int32.Parse(filterValue),                          //                                                               -1, isAdmin, pageIndex, pageSize,                          //                                                               sortField, (sortOrder == ""ASC""),                          //                                                               propertyNames, propertyValues);                          users = UserController.Instance.GetUsersAdvancedSearch(portalId, userId, -1,                                                                                         groupId,                                                                                         -1, isAdmin, pageIndex, pageSize,                                                                                         sortField, (sortOrder == ""ASC""),                                                                                         propertyNames, propertyValues);                      }                      else                      {                          users = new List<UserInfo>();                      }                      break;  ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
