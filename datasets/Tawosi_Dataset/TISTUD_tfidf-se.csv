We investigated, and noted that manipulating the pop-up for the SDK version would warn that the file had changed on the file system,and did she want to sync. With Shalom running us through some tests we determined a few things, most disconcerting is the fact that the Tiapp XML view had a different SDK listed than showed in the Overview.

Proposed Solution(s)    It would be good if you could specify by default whether you want to use the x86 or standard emulator for all projects, perhaps in {{Preferences -> Titanium Studio -> Titanium}}. It should be the standard emulator by default as the x86 emulator currently does not include the Google APIs (which would prevent the KitchenSink from running) and it does not support V8, as detailed in the linked ticket.

So:    # We need to upgrade our AVI detection to show the available ABIs per device  # For devices with multiple ABIs we need to allow the user to select which one to use as part of the launch configuration, and that is passed as the first argument to the SDK for SDKs 2.1+. For < 2.1, we only pass the device argument  # We could add a preference in Titanium Preferences to default to x86 or standard emulator (were available). This would se the default ABI selection in the launch configuration.  ","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This requires the following:    # For windows, add JDK, git and Node.js checks and installs to the installer  # For Mac, create an installer, and add Node.js check/install. Alternatively, publish Studio as an App Store app (requires OpenJDK: http://intransitione.com/blog/take-java-to-app-store/)  # For Linux (Ubuntu), create a proper package with dependencies.

For example, Ti.Network.INADDR_ANY is deprecated:    http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html#!/api/Titanium.Network-property-INADDR_ANY    But if you attempt to use it in code:    var foo = Ti.Network.INADDR_ANY;    Studio will prompt you with a description and not show it as deprecated, or issue any kind of warning.    We can now include a deprecation message along with the version number in the YML docs, and it would be good if we could convey that through JSCA. We actually have three keys in the YAML:    Obviously, we shouldn't prompt for APIs that have been removed. We could omit these from the JSCA, or add a new annotation to the JSCA so you can post an appropriate message.    Ingo said we'd need to rev the JSCA version number to change deprecated from a boolean to dict to accomplish this.    When a new version is available, we can update the JSCA generator.    * Create version 1.1 of the JSCA format that supports an expanded deprecated flag. It may be that we can also creatively update the existing fields, i.e. place the deprecation notes in the main description, and just add a ""removed"" field, like the ""since"" we already have.  * If an item is deprecated in the JSCA, we should display an appropriate warning in content assist. It may also be that we have a flag _not_ to show deprecated items by default  * Deprecated items should prompt a warning in both the editor gutter and the problems view, ideally with a note indicating what the replacement is.

Expected Result:    The installation was successful, which is ideal because we don't want half-installed software, and there should be a success toast in the lower-right corner, as with SDK downloads that are cancelled late during the extraction process.","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And we should have the notion of required installs versus optional (so user can ignore updates that aren't required, but must install/update required things).","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So for the base Studio, http://preview.appcelerator.com/appcelerator/studio/standalone/update/stable/ with be disabled and http://preview.appcelerator.com/appcelerator/studio/standalone/update/rc/ will be added and enabled.    This will apply to the add-on plugins that we provide as well, and we will keep the update url naming convention consistent across all the features. It will help reduce the likelihood of having incompatible versions of plugins installed against each other.

Problem description  Debugger is not correctly handling a breakpoint set for a function in the controller .js file    h5. Steps to reproduce  Android OS tested: 2.3.6 Nexus One, Android emulator    See the sample attached.    h6. index.xml      h6. index.js      1. Set a BreakPpoint at line 3 for the'alert($.label.text);'  2. Debug the App on Android     Result: App starts but the breakpoint is immediately triggered before displaying the Window (so just the splashscreen is displayed) and without having to click on the label.    From the Debug tab, it looks the behavior is wrong and that actually the wrong line is highlighted, focusing on the 'doClick() function' instead of the 'alert' function inside.    See the two screenshots, one for Android (wrong behavior), one for iOS (correct one, being triggered only when clicking on the sample 'label' for displaying the alert, not when starting the App).    3. Click to go past the breakpoint. Manually click on the app label to trigger the alert again.  Result: breakpoint is now ignored. Alert is being displayed.

Problem description  When a Warning or Error is found by the Code Analyzer for an Alloy project, Warning or Error icons are placed in the code gutter in the Resources file projects instead than in the App file projects. The result is that the Project is now marked with the red/white error icon and the 'Errors in Workspace' alert is displayed every time the project is being build.     'Resources' folder is by default not visible for Alloy projects on Studio, so the default result is also that the project is marked with an error icon, but the user can't see any other red error icon next to any visible Project file.    Also, having an error or a warning reported for the Alloy compiled code in the Resources folder is not adding much value for the user as the intended behavior is not to manually modify the compiled code files in the Resources (user should only handle Alloy files, all included into the App folder).    h5. Steps to reproduce    Paste the sample code. Note the code error in the controller.js , where foobar is actually not a function.  The error is correctly reported by the Code Analyzer (see the screenshot), also getting the correct position in the Alloy project.

Instead of asking user each time to run a series of commands on their machine to figure out the underlying problem, we can add those commands in the diagnostic tests and that should let us give a fair idea on what is going on user's machine with just the diagnostic test logs.    When the NPM updates are invoked, either during startup or by the user -    1) It verifies whether the package is installed on the machine using 'npm -g ls <package>' command.  1.1) If the above command fails for any reason, then invokes 'npm -p ls -g'  2) If the package is available on the machine, it figures out the installed version and latest available version using 'npm view <package> version' command.    Also, since PREFIX is one of those dark areas, we need to add the prefix configuration to the diagnostic logs.    1) Environment variable : Get the system property for NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX  2) Get the prefix key from the npm configuration : npm config get prefix  3) If only the environment variable is set, then the local prefix config value differs from the global one. That can lead to discrepancies in the installation of npm packages. So we should get the output for : 'sudo npm config get prefix'.

In our app/controller folder, we have a hierarchical structure that organizes our controllers in a logical fashion. For instance, we have the following:    app/  app/assets/  app/controllers/  app/controllers/file1.js  app/controllers/file2.js  app/controllers/file3.js  app/controllers/file4.js  app/controllers/file5.js  app/controllers/templates/another_controller1.js  app/controllers/templates/another_controller2.js  app/controllers/templates/another_controller3.js  app/controllers/templates/another_controller4.js  lib/  lib/...  ...    The same controller structure is mirrored for the styles and the views.    Now, when you open a controller, style or view that is not directly sitting in the folders app/controllers/, app/styles/ or app/views/, then you will not be able to use the new simplified navigation to open the other related files.

When using *autocomplete*, you get the following message (cf. screenshot) ""This compilation unit is not on the build path of a Java project"".    When removing the fake syntax error, the module packages fine, however it can no longer be worked on properly : no proper Java editing, have to ""guess"" all the fields.

Basically before there was a Windows Phone Publisher GUID (-G) that was required. We ended up never actually using that, and it was a holdover from the Win 8 Mobile Web hybrid app stuff. Now that value and config value are optional, not required. It's used to specify the old Windows 8 publisher ID that MS assigned you, in the scenario that you're publishing an ""upgraded"" version of the app for Win 8.1/10.    There's now a ""sister"" config value/option called the WIndows Phone product id for the same upgraded 8->8.1 app scenario. It's to specify the old Win 8 app id. see https://github.com/sgtcoolguy/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/master/cli/commands/_build/config/wpProductId.js  Again that's optional. I think it's ok to not surface either of these two config/command line options because they'd be used extremely rarely by our customers. (plus one is more global - the Win 8 publisher GUID, while the other is app-specific - the Windows Phone product id).    The important change is likely to make the pref page handle showing/editing the new Windows publisher Id config value now (in place of the Windows Phone Publisher GUID we discussed above that it currently surfaces). It's defined for the CLi here: https://github.com/sgtcoolguy/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/master/cli/commands/_build/config/winPublisherId.js  It's stored in the ti CLI config key windows.publisherId, and can be specified on the comm,and line with the --win-publisher-id or -I switch.

If debugging for emulator we do not see any error but app still hangs on the splash screen.    h5.Expected Results:  1. The app should launch fine & the breakpoint should be hit successfully.","  !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2017-05-10 15:40:10.825  !MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: ""Launching Appcelerator Android Device - abirsmk"".  !STACK 0  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/chromium/sdk/JavascriptVmFactory   at com.appcelerator.titanium.android.ui.launching.device.AndroidDebugOnDeviceLaunchConfigurationDelegate.getJavascriptVmFactory(AndroidDebugOnDeviceLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java:182)   at com.appcelerator.titanium.android.ui.launching.device.AndroidDebugOnDeviceLaunchConfigurationDelegate.connect(AndroidDebugOnDeviceLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java:252)   at com.appcelerator.titanium.android.ui.launching.device.AndroidDebugOnDeviceLaunchConfigurationDelegate.launch(AndroidDebugOnDeviceLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java:122)   at org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:885)   at org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:739)   at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin.buildAndLaunch(DebugUIPlugin.java:1039)   at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin$8.run(DebugUIPlugin.java:1256)   at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:54)  ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When we set JRE 9 with the Appcelerator Studio 4.10.0 RC - Studio is getting hung on the workspace dialog and not allowing the user to perform any action.    The only solution for this is - to upgrade the underlying Eclipse of the Appcelerator Studio. Studio is using Eclipse 4.4 and which need to be upgraded to the latest Eclipse to support JDK 1.9.

Here is my suggestion without uninstalling the existing JDK's.    # Make sure you're having JDK 1.8.131 on your system. Check this /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_1131.jdk  # Open Appcelerator Studio.ini file which you can find here {{/Applications/Appcelerator\ Studio/AppceleratorStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/AppceleratorStudio.ini}}  # Add below VM argument before the {{-vmargs}} and restart the studio.

Here is the direct link for JDK 1.8.131 - https://s3.amazonaws.com/titanium-studio/jdk/jdk-8u131-macosx-x64.dmg    If you think you also need JDK 1.8.152/153/JDK 9 on your system to support other applications. Here is my suggestion without uninstalling the existing JDK's.    # Make sure you're having JDK 1.8.131 on your system. Check this /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_1131.jdk  # Open Appcelerator Studio.ini file which you can find here {{/Applications/Appcelerator\ Studio/AppceleratorStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/AppceleratorStudio.ini}}  # Add below VM argument before the {{-vmargs}} and restart the studio.
