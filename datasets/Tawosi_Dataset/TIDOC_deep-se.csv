PROBLEM DESCRIPTION  The community has several questions about how to interact with icloud and their Ti Appcelerator apps.

Would be nice if we have an entry in the wiki or a blog post where we post how we handle icloud stuff.  ",8

"TIDOC-1284","09/27/2013 01:13:04","iOS7: Button background color and style has changed ","iOS7: Button background color and style has changed.    Affects Titanium UI Button    In iOS6, the button has a white background which cannot be changed.    The button background color only affects the corners.    In iOS7, the button white background with rounded corners is now gone.    This is on-par with the Android implementation.    This is a problem for code written for iOS6 because this will cause an unintended change in button appearance. See screenshot 'ios7-uniform-colors' to see the button disappear due to contrast issues.    Test Steps:    1. Run either of these sample codes on iOS6 and iOS7.    {code}  var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({   backgroundColor : 'navy',  });    var button = Ti.UI.createButton({   title : 'Button',   backgroundColor : 'navy',   color : 'navy'  });    win.add(button);    win.open();  {code}    {code}  var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({   backgroundColor : 'navy',  });    var button = Ti.UI.createButton({   title : 'Button',   backgroundColor : 'green',   color : 'black'  });    win.add(button);    win.open();   {code}    Result:    Notice the profound difference in appearance.

Notice that the app is named MB-Next-Gen-Phone   4. In the tiapp.xml change the <name> from ""<name>Travis</name>"" to ""<name>2Travis</name>""   5.

Remove the app on the device, and then Install the new app to the android device   7. Notice that there are 2 apps install: 2Travis & MB-Next-Gen-Phone.

Anything before **bb0423fb58dc9db40f648765aba03683ba77f1b4.cloudapp.appcelerator.com** portion will be treated as the same (ignore everything before this) and route it to the same app.  The ""**host**"" HTTP header will not be changed so that app can pull out the real URL itself and tokenize.

"TIDOC-1967","11/04/2014 14:20:11","Font size/color adjustments on docs.appcelerator.com","Maybe I'm just getting old, but I find the main font color on docs.appcelerator.com to be lacking sufficient contrast, and a point size too small.    Contrast is key when reading on a digital device (e.g. http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/04/e-ink-new-higher-contrast-carta-display-amazon-kindle-paperwhite/). Low contrast displays makes your eyes work harder to discern characters/words.     The body text on our docs currently use #484848, a nice subtle grey (which may be the JSDuck default color I'm not sure). For comparison, Android developer docs use #222, which is practically black (http://www.color-hex.com/color/222222).     For font size, we use a 13px font size for main body content. Again, maybe just me, but it seems a bit small and I always bump it up in the browser. For comparison, Android dev docs use a 14px body font size, and 13px for code fonts.     I've attached screenshots of an API page with the current and suggested font color/size changes:    - Color: #222 or 'black'  - 14px main font  - 13px code listing font     In the proposed screenshot, I also changed the font on the hierarchy (e.g, Titanium Proxy > Titanium Mobile > Titanium Accelerometer) from Courier New to the default sans-serif font...just because I think it looks better.

In openVZ environment, all the environment variables in blackList are reserved for nettle-server, with the docker change, there is no nettle-server anymore, so those environment variables can be used by user program now.

Currently, only iOS is supported. There are tickets (TIMOB-19485, TIMOB-19486, TIMOB-19487) to add support for DefaultIcon.png to the other platforms.    The DefaultIcon.png must be square. It should be 1024x1024, but must be at least 180x180 (60@3x). If the iTunesArtwork is missing and the DefaultIcon.png is at least 512x512, then the iTunesArtwork will be generated (same goes for @2x 1024x1024).    The DefaultIcon.png only comes into play if an app icon or iTunesArtwork is missing. Missing app icons will break the build. Missing iTunesArtwork will not.    NOTE: iTunesArtwork is only applicable to dist-adhoc builds. Older Titanium SDKs (4.x and older) copied iTunesArtwork for device and dist-appstore builds, but no more!    New Titanium apps will come with a DefaultIcon.png that is 1024x1024.    So, the major breakage is that if your app is missing an appicon, the build errors out. Existing apps won't have the DefaultIcon.png, so they will have to copy the file from a new project or create one (which they should do anyways).    The previous behavior of resizing the appicon.png or appicon@2x.png has been removed. Now appicon.png and appicon@2x.png are completely ignored.",3

By default, new projects build with 5.2.0.GA SDK will have this feature automatically enabled. Titanium takes the DefaultIcon.png as the logo to be displayed on the launchScreen on a white background. If desired, developers can choose a different logo of choice, by using LaunchIcon.png. If developers wish to fully customise the storyboard in Xcode, we support that too. Please see related tickets for more details.    Some key points:  - launchScreen.storyboard is required to be enabled, together with auto-layout, for the support of iOS9 feature SplitView/SlideView.  - If developers customise the storyboard in Xcode, it is advised not to use app-thinning at the moment, as it may result in unexpected behavior.",3

"TIDOC-2506","04/10/2016 06:47:08","Add more info to troubleshooting steps of ""Errors Logging In to Studio"" in documentation.","This is created on behalf of an intercom customer.     *Actual Scenario:*  I cannot log in to Appcelerator Studio (or using the appc command line utility). It keeps telling me my username/passoword are invalid, but I know they are not. I can login just fine using the same credentials on appcelerator.com.     *Cause:*    If the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to ""development"", the appc-platform-sdk module essentially assumes you are an internal developer for appcelerator and forces you to a pre-production or development environment if you have it configured.     I don't have development info configured so it was sending me to pre-prod.     I'm guessing pre-prod only has certain accounts whitelisted for login and just returns 4xx invalid login for everyone else which is why I was getting that error.    *Recommended Fixes*    1. *Use another (e.g. namespaced) environment variable*. This is only useful for your engineers internally so just namespace it to like APPC_NODE_ENV. NODE_ENV can be used by other developers and other projects for many uses (for better or for worse).    2. If you're in development mode, print this out at the top of appc commands that hit the API. If you're going to silently change how your entire module behaves for the end user, based on this common env variable, you should at least read that you're in development/preproduction mode and print this out to the user.    3.

Since iOS 7, the pre-packaged JScore framework has contained a debugging agent and protocol using webinspectord. We make use of this service/protocol with our newest iOS debugger in Titanium 6, as does Safari in it's tooling.    ## Debugging with Safari DevTools  Be sure to turn on use-jscore-framework as shown above first.    ### Launch the app on device or simulator    Simply launch your application via Studio, or the command line:  ```bash  appc run -p ios  ```    /!\ Be sure to connect your device by the USB cord first, if debugging on device.    ### Enabled Develop menu in Safari  Now open Safari and ensure you have the **Develop** menu enabled to appear. You can enable it from Safari's Preferences > Advanced.    ![Show Develop menu in menu bar](enabled_develop_safari.png ""Show Develop menu in menu bar"")    ### Connect to the app  Once the app is up and running, you can connect the debugger by:  - Simulator: **Safari > Developer > Simulator > JSContext**  - Device: **Safari > Developer > Device Name > JSContext**    #### Breakpoints early in app lifecycle not getting hit?    Sometimes you cannot connect the debugger to the app until it's already executed the code you'd like to break at. One way to workaround this is to launch the simulator first, then open **Safari > Develop > Simulator** and ensure **Automatically Show Web Inspector for JSContexts** and **Automatically Pause Connecting to JSContexts** are both turned on/checked. Then launch the app/build via Studio/CLI and you should be able to connect and control the debugger before the app fully launches.      ## Using Google Chrome and ios-webkit-debug-proxy  Be sure to turn on use-jscore-framework as shown above first.    Google has created a proxy middleman utility to be able to use Google's Chrome tooling with iOS simulators/webkit, and it is available at [ios-webkit-debug-proxy](https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy)    From my own experience, I haven't been able to reliably use this to hit breakpoints and inspect the state of the app. However, I have found the Console tab to work for evaluating arbitrary code in the context of the app.    If you'd like to try it out:  - Launch the Simulator  - Launch the app  - Open Terminal and start ios-webkit-debug-proxy  - Open Google Chrome to http://localhost:9221/  - Click on the [link for the simulator](http://localhost:9222/)  - Click on the [? link](http://localhost:9222/devtools/devtools.html?ws=localhost:9222/devtools/page/1) for the inspectable page",3

"TIDOC-3028","10/09/2017 23:50:51","Update Hyperloop docs","Add the following info to Hyperloop docs and reply back to Javier's email thread called FW: Questions from JB Hunt Visit:  Here answers to JB Hunt's questions/comments:  1) Does our API Builder product produce REST Type 3 or just REST type 2?    This refers to the Swagger version,  we currently support v2. Swagger has been renamed to OpenAPI and a new version 3 just came,  it will take some time before we see adoption.  V3 support is in our mid-term roadmap  (~ 6 months)  2) Can we use XIB files and storyboards in Hyperloop?  If not, is it on the roadmap.    3) Similar to above - can we support storyboards in Hyperloop?  #2 & #3: XIB files and Storyboards are supported. They just need to be programmatically loaded. There is an example for XIB files at https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples/blob/master/app/controllers/ios/xib.js and to use a storyboard they can to load it with https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboard  4) Can Hyperloop call a overloaded function of a class?  I believe the answer is ""no"" and that it is a limitation of Hyperloop.  If so, will this limitation ever be mitigated?  If so, where on the roadmap is this.  Hyperloop does support method overloading. On Android, Hyperloop will figure out the matching overloaded method of a class by inspecting the types of the given parameters. iOS has named parameters which results in different method names anyway, so that's a non-issue there.  5)  Q and A archives were removed from the website after the merger.  Can we get them back?  This was done before the Axway acquisition, over 2 years ago when was decided to move to StackOverflow,  an archive was keep for some time but most of the information was outdate.    The open source community created this Q&A using our old archives,  most of the info is out of date by now https://ti-qa-archive.github.io/  6) We need a real answer on debugging.  It hasn't really worked well since Alloy was introduced.  To me, the obvious reason is that we create  classic (non Alloy) code before running / debugging on a simulator or device.  The ties back to the XML / JS / TSS  are not intact during debugging.  I just tried to debug our Hyperloop Examples app by putting a breakpoint in the main listview's click event.  This breakpoint never got hit.    The debugging capabilities for Hyperloop in Studio are indeed not optimal right now. This is because Hyperloop modifies the source files which throws the debugger off its tracks. We have tickets like TIMOB-24037 that will be scheduled in the next couple of months  Nonetheless on iOS it is possible to debug apps using the Safari Web Inspector which allows debugging Hyperloop because it is directly talking to the active JS context inside the running app. Shockoe has posted a short tutorial how to do that here. This approach allows debugging all Hyperloop code up to where it switches over to the native side. The only downside to this is that there are no source maps available for processed Alloy controllers. We have also worked on the Android equivalent of this which allows using Chrome Dev tools in TIMOB-24723 and is currently under review.",1
