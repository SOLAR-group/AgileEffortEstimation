"CLOV-379","11/20/2008 13:34:07",2,"Surefire classpath is incorrect when depending on a jar and a test-jar from the same maven module ""We have two different applications that have the same symptom. Their test cases work properly when executed without clover, but when we run them with clover, they fail because classes or resource files are missing from the classpath.    When running the builds with clover, the test cases are executed multiple times. Only the last time they run they fail. When checking the maven debug output (using the -X option), I found that the last time the test cases are run, a JAR file is missing from the classpath. With both applications it is a jar file from a maven module for which we both depend on the jar and test-jar types of the module.     For example we have the following in the pom.xml file:            <dependency>              <groupId>${parent.groupId}</groupId>              <artifactId>server-data-access</artifactId>              <version>${version}</version>              <type>test-jar</type>              <scope>test</scope>          </dependency>          <dependency>              <groupId>${parent.groupId}</groupId>              <artifactId>server-data-access</artifactId>              <version>${version}</version>          </dependency>    And for some reason, when the test cases are executed for the last time, the following second dependency is not included in the list of jars in the classpath.    I have attached the pom.xml files from the module for which the test cases fail (server-web.pom), the pom.xml files from its parents, the pom.xml file for the module that generates both a jar and a test-jar (server-data-access.pom) and the log file that I get when running maven with the -X option.    This is the classpath when the test cases fail (notice that  /opt/bamboo/Bamboo/xml-data/build-dir/MONITORING-NIGHTLY/monitoring-server/server-data-access/target/server-data-access-1.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar

There's no documentation on confluence.atlassian.com in the BAMBOO space how such separation can be achieved.       Create a page with a description like:      If you use """"Automatically integrate Clover into this build"""" option, then Bamboo will add clover2:setup + clover2:clover goals into every Maven task found in the Job (more details can be found here). It means that you shall not use """"mvn deploy"""" together with automatic Clover integration.    There are at least three ways to solve this problem:    1) Create a separate Plan (or Job) in which automatic Clover integration is enabled and the Maven 2.x task does not deploy artifacts (""""mvn verify"""" is used for instance). So this plan would be used only for Clover reporting.    Benefits: full Clover separation from the Plan (or Job) performing deployment    Drawbacks: doubled Plan (or Job)    or    2) Use manual Clover integration (""""Clover is already integrated into this build"""") but run Clover in a parallel build lifecycle. It means that you'd have to configure Clover goals manually in the pom.xml and use the """"clover2:instrument"""" instead of """"clover2:setup"""". You could have then just one Maven task with """"mvn clean deploy"""". Instrumented jars would have -clover.jar suffix.    Benefits: build is executed only once    Drawbacks: sometimes there might be problems with resolving correct (""""cloverized"""") dependent artifacts for multi-module projects or deploying the instrumented war to test server    or    3) Use manual Clover integration, but run Clover in a default build lifecycle. It means that you'd have to configure Maven task manually and use """"clover2:setup"""" goal. Then you have to use two Maven tasks - one with """"... clover2:setup test ..."""" and one with """"deploy"""". This is an approach you have followed (according to screenshots I see in attached pdf).    Benefits: no problems with artifact dependencies    Drawbacks: two Maven tasks     Recommendation: approach #3.

There are two limitations of current design:    1) Test optimization might not work correctly for some test frameworks for Groovy language. This is due to nature of the Groovy language itself, where compiler allows to compile code which does not have all symbols resolved (they're being resolved at runtime). As a consequence if a dependent application class is changed, this does not to have trigger recompilation of the test class. See comment for more details.     2) Syntax highlighting in HTML report is always based on the latest class version, so if someone has older source file, it can be rendered incorrectly. There's a warning for this in HTML report, but we could fetch the actual line/char indexes from the older class version.    *Solution:*    1) Enhance UpdateableRegFile and keep all versions of classes. This should be optional and disabled by default.     2) Enhance RegFile API to allow querying for older versions of given file (by default it should always return the latest version).     3) Add new option for <clover-setup> and <clover-instr> to allow to keep full instrumentation history.

In this version of Unicode, the zero-width whitespace character (0x200B) is being treated as a whitespace.    JDK 7 implements Unicode 6.0. In this version of Unicode, the zero-width whitespace has been reclassified to the 'format character' group (other characters in this group are, for example, left-/right- text direction markers).    Thus, Java compiler in JDK 6 allows to use 0x200B as a normal whitespace character, e.g. separating symbols.     The Java compiler since JDK 7 silently ignores the 0x200B, which means that it cannot be used to separate symbols anymore. However you can put this character virtually in any place, e.g.:    {code:java}  void this<200B>Is<200B>MyMethod();  {code}    Clover fails on parsing the 200B character:        *Planned fix:*     * Ignore 200B characters in Java 7+. Treat 200B character as space in Java 6.   * Question: Shall it be based on source level setting or the JDK detected?   * Question: which other control characters needs to be ignored by Clover?   * Question: which other whitespace characters (other than space, \t, \n, \r) shall be recognized by Clover parser?    *Workaround:*    Remove all 200B character occurrences from the source code.
