"CONFCLOUD-30079","07/24/2013 05:53:39",0.5,"NullPointerException when attempting to render a JIRA issue where the resolution field has been hidden ""{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}   *NOTE:* This bug report is for *Confluence Cloud*. Using *Confluence Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-30079].   {panel}  Steps to reproduce: * Create an issue in JIRA (e.g. FOO-1). * Change the field configuration of that issue to set """"Resolution"""" to """"Hide"""" (if using the default Field Configuration, this can be done at /secure/admin/ViewIssueFields.jspa). * Edit a page in Confluence and insert a JIRA issue macro referencing FOO-1. * Save or Preview the page.  *Expected result:* FOO-1 should be rendered by the macro as normal.  *Actual result:* The following error is displayed: {quote} Error rendering macro 'jira' : com.atlassian.confluence.macro.MacroExecutionException: java.lang.NullPointerException {quote}  Full stack trace from the logs:   If the Resolution field is set back to """"Show"""", you will also need to flush Confluence's caches to get the macro working as expected (i.e. """"Flush All"""" on /wiki/admin/cachestatistics.action).   h5. Workaround: Uninstall JIRA Macros Plugin v5.0 and then download v4.0.29 from [Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/confluence.extra.jira/versions] and manually upload it into Confluence from the Plugin manager (Manage Add-Ons > Upload Add-On)."""," 2013-07-24 14:49:30,853 ERROR [TP-Processor1] [confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesMacro] throwMacroExecutionException Macro

This feature was removed due to observed low feature usage, in addition with our strategic focus to simplify the Confluence user interface and to keep and complex JIRA operations in JIRA. My apologies for the may customers that were quickly impacted by this, we could have done a better job in communicating this and ensuring we had understood your needs with regards to this matter.   Since then we've received a lot of feedback to bring back pagination. Thank you for those of you who provided helpful comments below, and for those customers we have been able to speak to about this. With this in mind, we have concluded the following:  * It is very clear that the current issue limit we have is insufficient and does not meet most of your needs.  * It is important for you to be able to see _all_ the issues requested  * We still believe that the use case of navigating 100+ issues within inside Confluence is something that is extremely low and is something which should be done in JIRA.  * Some of you mentioned of the importance of seeing this also in PDF exports when you share the release notes or pages with customers.   With that in mind, what will we be doing to address this? 1. We will look at increasing the limit of the total number of visible issues 2. In addition, we will look at providing a parameter to configure this. *Note:* You will always be limited by the total amount of issues JIRA provides, but [this setting can be changed|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ONDEMANDKB/Changing+maxResults+Parameter+for+JIRA+REST+API]. 3. We will be looking at also implementing CONF-30114 (sorting) to assist with dealing with larger issue lists in Confluence.   Thank you all for your patience in this matter, we will update this issue as we make progress.   Sherif Mansour Confluence Product Manager  Previous description:  {panel} The new JIRA issues macro does not paginate. This feature request is to help us better understand why customers want this.  If you are going to comment on this ticket, please provide some understanding for why you want pagination. We removed this feature because we saw very low usage of it. Since then, we've had a few requests to bring it back.   One way we could solve the majority use case is to increase the default amount of search results displayed. We are a bit hesitant to bring this back as we want to understand what it is that we are missing. If you are embedding 50/100+ issues on a page and want pagination, you probably shouldn't be doing that in Confluence, but rather the JIRA issue navigator - that is why we tell you """"there are xxx more issues, open in JIRA"""".   Please help us understand why you want this and some examples where you really do have lots of issues on a page that you want your end-users to read (if that is the use case) {panel} ""","",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is certainly an issue which has done its round on the internet over the years for many browser and application vendors alike, with each pointing the finger at each other as to whether the application or browser should observe the EXIF rotation metadata.  The obvious solution is for all browsers to support the 'image-orientation' CSS, however after many years this is still only supported by Firefox. We have explored no less than 6 different solutions to this issue as each brings pros and cons in terms of performance, behaviour and complexity. As a result of this exercise, it has been decided that image rotation would be done server side based on the EXIF rotation metadata.  The actual implementation is somewhat different for Server and Cloud deployments, and thus the rollout/delivery may occur at different times, however is high up in the queue right now.

Summary  Images in tables that are not manually sized increase in size or are missing when exported to PDF.    h3. Steps to Reproduce  # Create a table in a Confluence Page  # Insert an image in one of the cells  # Export page to PDF    h3. Expected Results  The exported PDF matches what is displayed in the page when viewed    h3. Actual Results  The small image is displayed much larger than its actual size or the image is missing in the table.    h3. Workaround  Updated on Feb 21 2018: the original workaround is not available anymore in the current version of Confluence Cloud.  Minimizing the image can solve the issue in PDF, but this workaround will affect the view in wiki.  h3.

Summary Whenever a user inserts special characters as content in Confluence, and an inline comment is created from that content, the resulting Space Export will convert the special characters and the resulting string in the entities.xml import will be greater than the original string.

Expected Results The space export does not add characters for special characters.  h3. Notes For the error to be replicated in an import, the original string has to be close to 255 characters. If the string is not close, the conversion will not affect the import as it will remain under 255.  h3.Workaround Edit the inlie comment to be shorter/remove the special characters.

There is no logging at other levels either.  I suspect this began after implementing the Office Connector [canary process|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/JVM+crashes+during+Import+from+Word+in+Confluence], however it could also have been due to the dependency changes required for plugins4.  Logging for the canary process and some parts of the Office Connector  (eg below) go to the catalina.out, but is not formatted in the usual way (eg the timestamp). This is because it uses an SLF4J SimpleLogger, which is by design - it runs in an entirely separate JVM and is stripped down to pure essentials. It appears as though the dependencies from this module are bleeding into the main JVM and breaking logging for the whole plugin.
