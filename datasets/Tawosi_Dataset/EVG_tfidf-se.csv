From this, it appears that it is possible for two patches on the same commit submitted at the same TIMESTAMP to wind up with the same 'build_id's and 'task_id's.    Without considering backwards compatibility issues, it looks like for patch builds, the 'build_id' and 'task_id' should be using the 'version_id' in place of the 'revision' field.    Alternatively, if 'version_id' for patches were 'project_<UNIQUEID>', then 'build_id' and 'task_id' could remove the 'project' and 'revision' expansions and just use 'version_id' instead, as it would include project information and a unique identifier:    * 'build_id' – roughly {{""""$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}""""}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{""""$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{task_name\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}""""}}    It would be even more consistent, perhaps, to put timestamp after 'version_id' since that's what it's tied to, which would give you:    * 'build_id' – roughly {{""""$\{version_id\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}\_$\{build_variant\}""""}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{""""$\{build_id\}\_$\{task_name\}""""}}    TIMESTAMP could even go first, before 'version_id', which has the added value of allowing id's to sort chronologically (e.g. listing contents of an S3 bucket):    * 'build_id' – roughly {{""""$\{TIMESTAMP\}\_$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}""""}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{""""$\{build_id\}\_$\{task_name\}""""}}    Following that logic, you could add a new expansion:    * 'expansion_id' – roughly {{""""$\{task_id\}\_$\{expansion\}""""}}    Then all the unique identifier expansions would build logically and consistently on each other.    That would simplify the job of users choosing an expansion for naming artifacts to S3:    * Need something to reuse across tasks for a build: use just 'build_id'  * Need some task output for external consumption (e.g. a release tarball): use just 'task_id'  * Need to save debugging output from a particular task run: use just 'execution_id'""","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

There may exist a Jira ticket, but when just looking at the trend graph, there's no marker or link to say that this jump 3 weeks ago is a known issue. A lot of time is then wasted by the build baron re-discovering things that are already known.    We'd like to change the display so that, in addition to displaying change points, Build Failures are also rendered onto the trend graphs.    BF tickets have 'Evergreen Project', 'Failing Buildvariants', 'Failing Tasks' and 'First Failing Revision' / 'Fix Revision' fields that can be used to link to the point in the trend graphs.    When a BF and a Change Point exist for the same revision, the BF should take precedence (as this indicates that the change is known or is being worked on). ""","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

This approach produces abnormal values distribution. For example, ratio 1/3 is closer to 1 than ratio 3/1.  To fix this issue we could use different approaches:  * apply log function: log(Sa / Sb). In this case log(1/3) = -log(3/1) and also log(1/1) = 0 (I think it fits the best for charts, for example trend chart)  * or modify existing function, so we could keep percentages: (sign(Sa / Sb) * max(Sa.

The two most frequent calls are DescribeInstances, which EVG-3251 moved to a batch call, and DescribeSpotPriceHistory, which this ticket is meant to address. We call this function in two places, in describeHourlySpotPriceHistory, which is called by the task end and host idle jobs, and by getLatestLowestSpotCostForInstance, which is called each time we spawn an ec2 host with type auto, to determine if we should spawn an on-demand or a spot host.    I believe we should do two things:   # Query Splunk for the logging in describeHourlySpotPriceHistory and getLatestLowestSpotCostForInstance to determine if one of these functions represents the bulk of the calls to DescribeSpotPriceHistory. They may both be used heavily, since the former is called each time we spawn a host, and the latter each time a task ends.   # Figure out how to cache these data. (The two cases use different parameters, but I think this is only because getLatestLowestSpotCostForInstance passes a future date to only get the latest price, so we can make the calls identical). It might make sense to cache these data. We can use their granularity to determine our caching strategy, or use 1-minute granularity, since it's unlikely we care to make finer distinctions than that.""","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

There seems to be a negative consequence to this, which is that for very large logs, editing the current search term becomes quite laggy. That is, trying to quickly type a term or delete a few characters becomes much slower than you would expect from a responsive text input box. Here is one [example log|https://logkeeper.mongodb.org/lobster/build/834158c1a5f92af0f569f178be004413/test/5b809f89c2ab68145a00ea9d#bookmarks=0%2C183196] that exhibits this behavior. It is a bit over 180,000 lines.     Depending on user's preferences, one fix would be to consider _not_ updating the highlighted search terms until a user presses """"Enter"""" again. Only then would the highlighted search terms update to reflect the current text value in the search bar. Personally, I prefer this behavior since it ensures that the current context is not changed while entering a new search term i.e. if I am focused on one particular log line while entering a new search term, I know that the logs won't be scrolled to a different position until I actually press """"Enter"""".

If the connection between disabling scheduling tasks and quarantining the hosts in the distro can make some sense in theory, it doesn't seem right that it's intentional because it requires 10 failed agent deploys. Also, unchecking that box doesn't automatically unquarantine the servers in that distro, so this logic seems incorrect.    Is this behavior intentional?""","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Additionally, there is a multitude of timeouts that can be set throughout evergreen configuration. One has to go through the docs to identify the appropriate timeout for each case.

Evergreen GitHub pull request testing has a similar interface. To be included in a pull request, the code must be committed locally.    Evergreen's patch command differs. It includes changes to files tracked by git that have changed in the working directory but have not yet been committed. This has been confusing for users in the past (e.g., EVG-782). It also does not match the merge queue command, which will mean that users of the merge queue via the CLI might submit code reviews that differ from what they ship to the merge queue.    *Solution*: Evergreen's patch command currently supports submitting only committed changes by passing the {{--ref}} flag. This ticket will make that the default.    Many teams outside the server use pull request testing and will therefore be unaffected. However, some teams may rely on the current behavior and may be surprised by the change. To address this, we will   * Warn the user when they are submitting a patch if there uncommitted changes in their working directory.   * Send an email notifying users that we are making this change.   * Add an option to the {{patch}} command that preserves the old behavior.   * Add an option to the .evergreen.yml that will cause the old behavior to be the default    The feature is documented in the Evergreen Wiki: [https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Using-the-Command-Line-Tool#working-tree-changes]""","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
