"MULE-6861","05/30/2013 16:28:55",5,"Watermark / Binding object store items to flow variables ""h1. Watermarking       Right now, when a poll needs to deal with updated objects, we use watermarks as an approach to filter out elements that were already processed.  Watermarks require a value to be persisted across flow invocations. Typically, this value will have a default the first time used, and will be used as part of a query or outbound request. Based on how the flow processes the results, the value may be updated.      This can be done using several steps:       - Fetch a value form a persistent object store and save it as a flow variable       - Refer to the flow variable when doing a query / outbound request       - Update the variable based (either once - i.e. the watermark is the date of the query, or per record - i.e. the watermark is the highest id from an object)       - At the end of the processing, persist the value to the persistent object store         This pattern is very common in synchronisation flows. Enough common to deserve better support. To make this easier out of the box we will add a new optional parameter to <poll> that will provide the watermarking variable persistence out of the box.    Watermark Example:        h2. Watermark properties      * variable (required): This attribute signals both the object store key that will be used to store this watermark as also the name of the flowVar in which its value will be exposed to the user.   * default-expression (required): In case that the key above can't be found on the object store, the default expression is used to generate a value. This is useful for the first run of the flow   * update-expression (optional): The result of this expression will be used to update the watermark once the execution is finished. It defaults to the value of the variable parameter.  * objectStore-ref (optional): A reference to the object store you wish to use to store the watermarks. If not provided, the default user object store will be used     h2. Watermark behaviour     * It is bound to the poll   * It is bound to synchronous flows only. If not then it execution must fail  * When executed, it goes to the configured object store looking for a value of the given key. If found, that value is exposed through a flowVar using the same key.   * If no value is found for that key in the object store, then the default-expression is executed and that value is exposed through the flowVar.  * Watermark will also fire a notification interceptable by the event tracking module. The underlaying tracking event will be enriched with the watermark value.  * The message processors will be executed.  * If the flow was correctly executed, then the watermark will be updated.   * After updating the object store, another notification is fired to the event tracking system so that the new value can also be recorded there   * If the intercepted processors throw any exceptions, then the watermark will not be updated. Since the watermark is stored in the object store, the user can always use a exception strategy to put a custom value in case of failure.  * In case the watermark value is not serializable then fail the store of the watermark in the object store  ""","  <flow name=""""pollSalesforce"""">                 <poll frequency=""""10m"""">           <watermark key=""""lastModifiedDate""""               default-expression=""""#[lastYear()]""""               object-store-ref=""""myOS"""" />           <sfdc:search query=""""Select Id,Name from Account where LastModifiedDate >= #[flowVars['lastModifiedDate']]""""/>         <foreach>               <set-variable name=""""accountLastModified"""" value=""""max(payload['LastModifiedDate']], flowVars['accountLastModified'])""""/>         </foreach>    .....  </flow>  ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"MULE-8173","12/19/2014 13:34:09",5,"Add protocol attribute to listener-config and request-config to improve usability ""Currently is difficult for an user to realice how to configure HTTPS for listening HTTP requests or sending HTTP requests. The way to do that currently is by defining a TLS Context element (which can be empty for sending request, in such case it will use jvm default certificatess) inside the listener-config or de request-config element. That it's not straightforward if the user is working with XML and for users that do not know that SSL / TLS is the protocol behing HTTPS isn't either despite they use Studio.    The idea is to add a protocol attribute (with default value HTTP) in the listener-config and the request-config.  - Listener config:     - if user sets protocol=""""http"""" or provides no values then we validate that the user didn't put a TlsContext.     - If user sets protocol=""""https"""" we validate that the user provided a TlsContext with at least a keystore configured on it.   - Request config:     - if user sets protocol=""""http"""" or provides no value then we validate that the user didn't put a TlsContext     - if user sets protocol=""""https"""" and provides no TlsContext config then we create a TlsContext by default (implicitly) using the default jvm certificates  - if http is selected, port 80 is used by default  - if https is selected, port 443 is used by default    The usability improvements is:   From Studio the user has a much more easy way to find where to define the use of HTTPS since it's going to be in the main configuration section of both listener-config and request-config   From XML the user will see a hint from the XML content assistant to pick the protocol right in the listener-config element or request-config element.    With the new behaviour there's no reason to support an empty tls:context element in the config.  When we rebuild the current TCP transport ideally we can reuse the same mechanism as in HTTP (no idea what the """"protocol"""" attribute would be called in that case) or add support for an empty tls:context again.

Problem  According to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5 refresh_token is optional:  {quote}     Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh     tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are     used to obtain a new access token when the current access token     becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens     with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter     lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource     owner).  Issuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the     authorization server.  If the authorization server issues a refresh     token, it is included when issuing an access token (i.e., step (D) in     Figure 1).  {quote}  More detail about this in:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.1  {quote}  Successful Response     The authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh     token, and constructs the response by adding the following parameters     to the entity-body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code:       access_token           REQUIRED.  The access token issued by the authorization server.       token_type           REQUIRED.  The type of the token issued as described in           Section 7.1.  Value is case insensitive.       expires_in           RECOMMENDED.  The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For           example, the value """"3600"""" denotes that the access token will           expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.           If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the           expiration time via other means or document the default value.       refresh_token           OPTIONAL.  The refresh token, which can be used to obtain new           access tokens using the same authorization grant as described           in Section 6.       scope           OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client;           otherwise, REQUIRED.  The scope of the access token as           described by Section 3.3.    {quote}  Current implementation of OAuth2 authorization-code-grant-type is expecting always to get refresh_token so if the OAuth2 server during a refresh token operation sends only the access_token Mule is failing to get the refresh_token with the following exception:      h5. Proposed Solution  As described in the spec if there is a refresh_token issued by the OAuth2 server it should be used for getting new access_tokens if not it should fail when the current access_token is no longer valid (after a 401/403 status code and before retrying the request) and a exception of type should be thrown.

If a     new refresh token is issued, the refresh token scope MUST be     identical to that of the refresh token included by the client in the     request.  {quote}    It is up to be interpreted by readers but an interpretation would be: if the authorization server didn't return a new refresh_token the old one should be used when refreshing the access_token next time.    This scenario is what some servers called it """"offline"""" or """"never expire"""" and it is used mostly with APIs from mobiles.  Google's OAuth2 server supports this scenario:  https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#offline  But they would also would need to support RFC 7009 'OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation' in order to allow uses to revoke an """"offline""""/""""never expire"""" refresh token for a given user/app.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009  On the other hand, other implementations such Box.com do not support this and they always issue to clients both tokens during a refresh access_token. https://www.box.com/blog/oauth2-update-longer-lived-refresh-tokens/    h5. Proposed implementation  As the specification has this """"optional"""" scenario where refresh_token 'MAY' not be issued by the server when refreshing the access_token, the OAuth2 component should keep the old 'refresh_token' for next attempt.  MULE-9660 changed the behaviour to log a warning message if 'refresh_token' was not issued by the authorization server instead of failing, it was always expecting to get both tokens with every refresh token operation. So, that would be modified to keep the old refresh_token instead and the warning message reverted.   If during the next attempt to get a new access_token using the old refresh_token happens after the refresh_token was revoked in authorization server, an unauthorized exception would be thrown.""","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Problem  During the disposal process of the application classloader the DriverManager is called to get the registered drivers in order to deregister them if they were loaded with the current classloader.    The DriverManager has an static block code that loads by SPI the drivers present in the classloader (from where the DriverManager was called) so whenever  is called during the classloader's disposable phase if the OracleDriver was not used by the application it will be loaded when  is called just before it will be deregistered by the releaser.

This will make the *ACK* operation always fails because the new connection won't find a session to make the message an ACK.  Also doing a *consume* and a *ack* doesn't have a deterministic result, due that in both operations a different connection could be configured.  ** As a possible solution implement something like {{HttpRequesterConnectionManager}} for HTTP Connector https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/pull/3923/files. That is having a shared state between all the configurations where the messages/sessions are referenced to be able to do an ACK without depending of the injected connection in the ACK Operation.  * Change the *ackId* of the JMSAttributes from a *Optional<String>* to a *String*, due that this implies that the Mule user will need to unwrap the optional value at runtime.  * Review the implications of a {{transacted}} ACK Mode.  * With client ack mode, the messages are generated from a same session, the JMS spec defines that the ACK is done over a session, not over a particular message, so doing a ACK over a message will not only produce the ACK over this one althought the messages of the entire session doesn't matter if these had been sucessfully processed or are still in flight.

"MULE-12039","03/23/2017 16:16:28",8,"Change how configuration resolution works ""The configuration resolution for operations without an explicit reference is sometimes confusing:    a. If you don't have a validation configuration, it will create and use a default one.   b. If you have only 1 validation configuration, it will be automatically used as the default one.   c. If you have more than 1, you need to specify on each validation operation what configuration to use.     Consider the following 3-step scenario using the validations extension:     1) You initially develop Validation_A, which has no need for a validation configuration. Therefore you leave config-ref blank. Validation A works successfully.   2) Later, you develop Validation_B, which needs Validation_Configuration_1. Validation_B references Validation_Configuration_1, and it works. However, now, without changing anything about Validation_A, it now uses a completely different validation configuration, and it may not work.   3) Even later, you develop Validation_C, which needs Validation_Configuration_2. Validation_C references Validation_Configuration_2, and it works. However, now, while still not changing anything about Validation_A, it fails completely (and it goes uncaught until runtime!!!).     As it works now, making a change completely unrelated to a working validation can cause that validation not to work. After talking with my fellow developers, we agreed: a validation with no config-ref should work the same way no matter how many validation configurations exist within the project.     We can see a case for a validation always being required to define a config-ref. Or we can see a case for a validation with no config-ref always using the default configuration. But we do not think it makes sense for a validation with no config-ref to work differently (and potentially break) depending on how many unreferenced validation configurations are in the project.    We need to change to:    * Operations without a config-ref will share the same implicit config (when possible), even if several explicit configs are defined  * Operations with an explicit config ref with honour that config, even if an implicit one was created.""","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Instances of that class are created using a org.mule.runtime.api.message.AbstractMuleMessageBuilderFactory implementation which is found via SPI.  Mule API jar does not contain any implementation of the that factory.   In a previous version of  org.mule.runtime.api.message.Message class, there was a NULL_MESSAGE constant which, in order to be built, it required a builder to be available on the class path.  Because of some change required to provide a privileged API, the container classloader has to be used to find the message factory, instead of using the current thread's context classloader. This change, made visible a problem with the API/implementation approach as under some scenarios, there is no message builder factory available.  For example, the extensions maven plugin used to build SDK extensions, depends on Mule API only. When extensions has org.mule.runtime.api.message.Message on their API, then the plugin will need to load that class to do some processing. This will fail, as before, if there is any message constant that require to be build on the Mule API side.

See this post (maybe a bit exaggerated, but the general idea is probably correct):  http://www.odi.ch/weblog/posting.php?posting=689    The purpose of this issue is to determine how many tests are broken, and if the migration is easy then doing it. Regarding APIs, all standard factories should be compatible but comparisons of XML fragments in our tests may fail due to differences in spacing, order, namespaces, etc.    Conclusions:  - It was possible to remove them.  - We are still using Woodstox XMLInputFactory and Saxon TransformerFactory in some places, but explicitly.  - licm (License Manager) required modifications.  - By including Woodstox or Saxon JARs in the classpath we are changing the default XMLInputFactory and TransformerFactory implementations. But as we use them through XMLSecureFactories for security settings, at least in our code we use the Java provided implementations. User applications and other code will use Woodstox/Saxon if loaded, and it can't be changed unless we remove their META-INF/service providers.""","",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
