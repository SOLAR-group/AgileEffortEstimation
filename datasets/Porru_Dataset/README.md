# Porru Dataset

This directory consists 16 dataset files, two files per each of the 26 projects:
- 8 files with "\_deep-se" suffix are prepared to be used by Deep-SE.
- 8 files with "\_tfidf-se" suffix are prepared to be used by TF/IDF-SE.

These 8 files are collected from 6 open source repositories by Choetkiertikul et al. [1] up until August, 2016.
The files named after their project key as "[project key]\_[approach].csv" e.g. MESOS_deep-se.csv, which is the set of issues collected from Appache repository Mesos project, and contains the features that Deep-SE needs for prediction. 

The following table shows the list of projects and the repositories where the project was collected from.

## Information on the content of the files ##

- Each csv file for Deep-SE approach contains 4 columns: *issuekey*, *title*, *description*, and *storypoint*. 

- Each csv file for TF/IDF-SE approach contains more than 4 columns: starting with *issue key*, *storypoint*, *context*, *codesnippet*, and a set of one-hot columns for issue type (header starting with t\_) and then component(s) ((header starting with c\_)). 

- The issues are sorted based on issue's creation time (i.e. the former issues was created before the latter issues).
