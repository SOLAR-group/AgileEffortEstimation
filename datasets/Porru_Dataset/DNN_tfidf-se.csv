Subsequently, Presenters inheriting from ModuleSettingsPresenterBase&lt;TView&gt; will have to instantiate these two dictionaries inside their constructors or else a Null Reference Exception will be thrown when trying to access them.

Unchecking the ""Include in Menu?"" option does not result in the page being removed from the Console display.

Despite the fact that the Console isn&amp;apos;t expressly a menu, the behaviour still falls outside what I would expect -- which is that the page would not be listed in the Console.


Clear Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a page.
2. Create a second page (in my case as a child of the first).
3. Edit the settings of the second page to not be included in the menu.

In the host settings, there is an option to disable &amp;apos;Show Copyright Credits&amp;apos;. With this option disabled, performing exactly nine postbacks on a page with an asp.net control will cause the page to load with no css. This issue was reported a long time ago here:

More recently, our friends are SportsDirect have stumbled upon it while working with some custom modules.

Here are their comments on the issue:

""After further investigation, this error only happens when you are injecting something into the head of the page during the OnLoad event. I think there must be a conflict between how DNN removes the copyright text from the page and our code that was injecting into the page.
I have moved our event to the OnInit event and this is no longer causing and issue.
FYI - I have attached a simple sample module that shows this issue. It injects some example text into the page header and demonstrates a simple postback. On the ninth postback all page CSS is lost.""

Not sure if this happens on clean installs, so I am listing the way our demo environment is able to reproduce this. I can post a backup of the environment should you not be able to reproduce this issue again.


I used EE for this, but this feature should be the same across all editions.


I marked this as ""Minor"" but this looks horrible in our sales demos to prospective customers.


Clear Steps to Reproduce:

    Clean install of 06.02.00
    Upgrade incrementally to 06.02.02
    Populate the Portals directory with several files of various types (can be done prior to upgrade too)
    Ensure that at least one of those files is a HTML template file
    Login with any user that can edit content (I used a Host user)
    Edit content in a HTML module
    Choose the Template Manager in the editor

Actual Result:

DNN-24060,1.0,".dnn7 manifest not honored in module installation process In previous versions of DotNetNuke (5 and 6), when you installed a module through the Host &gt;&gt; Extensions screen, the installer was able to use a .dnn5 and .dnn6 manifest file instead of the default .dnn manifest file. "".DNN5"" was honored for DNN 5 installs and "".DNN6"" for DNN 6 installs. This functionality is missing from DNN 7. Can we add a "".dnn7"" extension that would be honored when installing a module? Currently, the DNN 7 installer still honors the "".dnn6"" extension, but not a .dnn7 extension.


I opened up the Source for DNN and found there were two places this needed to be changed. It&amp;apos;s a super simple change since the functionality exists in DNN 5 and DNN 6 and just needs an extra couple lines added in DNN 7. I&amp;apos;ve attached the two effected files, which are found in the DNN source code package here:  /Community/Library/Services/Installer


All that&amp;apos;s need is an extra Case in the Case statement on line 464 of InstallFile.cs and and additional if statement on line 389 in InstallerInfo.cs. These changes are reflected in the attachment.

DNN-24342,2.0,"Hide Command Bar Querystring Parameter On some modules, it can be helpful for developers to be able to hide the command bar. In DNN6 this could be done using a special skin, but, in 7, the command bar is injected at the top of the page and so the skin approach doesn&amp;apos;t work.


The procedure that injects the command bar is in Skin.cs. Before doing so, it evaluates two querystring parameters - popup and dnnprintmode. Both of those hide the command bar, but, both also do other things. 


I think we should add a third parameter - hidecommandbar. Then, this could be used by developers to hide the command bar - even in admin mode - when needed. Because it&amp;apos;s just a querystring parameter, and that&amp;apos;s all it does, this should be a very simple addition. Here is the revised code:


        private void InjectControlPanel()
{
//if querystring dnnprintmode=true, controlpanel will not be shown
if (Request.QueryString[""dnnprintmode""] != ""true"" &amp;&amp; Request.QueryString[""popUp""] != ""true"" &amp;&amp; Request.QueryString[""hidecommandbar""] != ""true"")

DNN-2964,5.0,"Cannot Allow Non-Admins to Manage Users Brief Description of Issue:
In DNN 7, we have broken the ability for Admins to be able to allow non-admins to manage users on their site.  This is a very common use case where organizations would typically allow lower level person(s) or certain managers the ability to manage users.  This is an especially common use case among social websites where community managers will need to field user account issues, but do not need or should not have administrator privileges..
We have broken this capability in DNN 7.  No longer can you give non-admins access to the User Accounts page and allow them to manage users.  You cannot even allow this when putting the module on a non-admin page.  You can still get to manage the user&amp;apos;s security roles, but you cannot create new users or edit existing users.
Since I personally know of numerous sites that do this in 6.x and am even talking to customers regularly that want to do this, I have given this a higher priority and severity.  I hope that we can get this fixed sooner than later.  :)

When adding a new security role, the following fields are presented in advanced settings tab:

Trial Fee, Trial period (every), dropdownselection(day/week/month etc);
 
Currently it is possible to select ""dropdownselection(day/week/month etc)"" without entering text in ""Billing period (every)"" textbox.

1. Add new security role: Enter a service fee, a trial fee, leave Billing and Trial periods blank but make a selection for dropdownselection for both Billing and Trial.
2. Click on Edit security role: Service fee is set to 0.00. This is a bug. Trial fee is set to 0.00. This is also a bug. Both dropdownselections are forgotten. This is also a bug.

DNN-25759,2.0,"DAM  Please add ability to extend the width of the left treeview pane Enhancment request for DAM module:
(Build 637)
Currently, the width of the left treeview pane (folder tree) on the left is fixed. User can choose to completely hide the treeview pane or show it in its standard width. But there is no way to adjust to width of this pane.
A scrollbar appears on the bottom, using which the user can scroll to a folder that is buried deep into the subfolders, but this is still very painful to use. I can imagine how difficult this will be when the folder structure is at an enterprise level.
As far as I can remember, I have always hated to scroll horizontally. User gets claustrophobic after a few minutes of using the folder treeview.

Proposed enhancement:  

When the treeview pane is visible, the user should be able to adjust the width. On the border, the icon should change to a double-sided arrow in order for the user to drag it. 
When the treeview pane is not visible, the user should NOT be able to adjust the width.
When adjusting the width, the user should NOT be able to reduce the width.
When adjusting the width, the user should be able to increase the width to a MAX of double the standard width (no more).
When the toggle button is clicked, the treeview hides completely no matter what the current width of the treeview was.
For every change in width, the horizontal scrollbar should adjust accordingly.
Nice to have: The width of the ""Name"" column on the main gridview should adjust according to the changing width of the treeview panel as the user adjusts the panel widths. The width of all other columns on the gridview stays the same. Now, we are talking!
Horizontal Scrollbar still exists just in case the folder structure is really deep. ",,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DNN-3017,2.0,"SI: Add Database Indexes to Improve Performance A customer has contacted us via a support ticket with a few suggestions for indexes on various tables, which they believe would increase performance. The customers original concern was complications during future upgrade as a  result of their modifications to the database. I suggested to them that perhaps adding these indexes to the core DNN db schema would be mutually beneficial, in that it would increase performance of our product and also avert their potential upgrade woes.
 
The customer supplied the following information regarding the indexes for our review/consideration.
 
 
DNN Indexing Recommendations The following are all Non-Clustered/Non-unique SQL2008 index recommendations.
These recommendations are suggested based on our usage of DNN Enterprise and Community at Cherokee Nation. Advantage is the average percentage benefit that user queries could experience if this missing index group was implemented. The value means that the query cost would on average drop by this percentage if this missing index group was implemented.

The UI piece should hook up to the settings.doNotRedirect property for each individual page.  As this is a delimited list, we should perhaps look at including it as a setting attached to the tab table instead?
To stop a page being generated as an advanced Url, the UI should hook up to the setttings.useBaseFriendlyUrls property.  Again, this is a delimited list, we should probably put this in as a new column in the tabs table.

DNN-26462,1.0,"6.2.0.SqlDataProvider - Alter Table UserRoles error during upgrade This occurred while upgrading from 5.6.1 to 7.0.5.  The log file is attached.
 
The 6.2.0.sqlDataProvider will error if the UserRoles table contains the columns, Status and/or IsOwner.  The check for each column exists does not appear to be correct - it always returns false.  I ran this upgrade on several instances of 5.6.1 and only 1 failed - the production instance, of course.  I am not sure why the other instances did not have these columns, but our production instance did.
 
Here are the 2 scripts that fail:
/* Add new Columns To UserRoles Table *//**************************************/
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Columns WHERE TABLE_NAME=&amp;apos;{databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}UserRoles&amp;apos; AND COLUMN_NAME=&amp;apos;Status&amp;apos;) BEGIN ALTER TABLE {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}UserRoles ADD [Status] int NOT NULL CONSTRAINT DF_{objectQualifier}UserRoles_Status DEFAULT 1 ENDGO

The issue is in the WHERE clause of the EXISTS check.  The databaseOwner should not be part of the table name as there is a separate column for that in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.  Here are the changes I made to get this to run successfully on our upgrade:
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Columns WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA=&amp;apos;{databaseOwner}&amp;apos; AND TABLE_NAME=&amp;apos;{objectQualifier}UserRoles&amp;apos; AND COLUMN_NAME=&amp;apos;Status&amp;apos;) BEGIN ALTER TABLE dbo.dnn_UserRoles ADD [Status] int NOT NULL CONSTRAINT DF_dnn_UserRoles_Status DEFAULT 1 END   IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Columns WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA=&amp;apos;{databaseOwner}&amp;apos; AND TABLE_NAME=&amp;apos;{objectQualifier}UserRoles&amp;apos; AND COLUMN_NAME=&amp;apos;IsOwner&amp;apos;) BEGIN ALTER TABLE dbo.dnn_UserRoles ADD IsOwner bit NOT NULL CONSTRAINT DF_dnn_UserRoles_IsOwner DEFAULT 0 END

I have for example an HTML module with a lot of javascript in the head section of the settings and only one simple canvas element in the content.

Solution: DNN has internal methods for saving a complete page or even a complete website as a template, with all settings. But when exporting and importing module content, these methods are not used. Instead there is a special solution for this which only fetches the content and nothing else.
Attachment: I attached 3 changed files of the core which changes this behaviour to the standard DNN way and allows to export and import a module with all the settings. There are only minor changes in codebehind of export.ascx and import.ascx and 1 new method in ModuleController.cs. If an old template is selected for import, import goes the old way and a new template imports the whole thing with settings and permissions
Enhancements: I did not change the UI of import.ascx. Perhaps it would be a great enhancement to add some checkboxes like: Include Settings, Include Content, Include Permissions. If IncludeContent is checked by default and the others not this is the behaviour like before. You could easy add these values as parameters to the new Method in ModuleController and add some ""if""-statements.",,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

DNN-26919,1.0,"dnn.controlBar.init does not check for module to exist when scroll to top. The dnn.controlBar.init does not seem to check that the module exists during scroll-to-top operations.
 
History
I had been logged in as my host account and added a new control to a page.  Apparently something went wrong under the hood (I&amp;apos;d post a report if I could track it down).  During debugging the issue (which I still can&amp;apos;t resolve) I noticed that the following line was causing java-script errors:
varmoduleTop=(module.offset().top-50);
The module.offset() method was returning null and causing the top property to fail.  To resolve this issue, I placed a module check around line 1148 so the final code looks like this:
// fade module if needed
varfadeModule=dnn.dom.getCookie(&amp;apos;FadeModuleID&amp;apos;);
if(fadeModule){
dnn.dom.setCookie(&amp;apos;FadeModuleID&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,-1);
varanchorLink=$(&amp;apos;a[name=""&amp;apos;+fadeModule+&amp;apos;""]&amp;apos;);
varmodule=anchorLink.parent();
// **** ADDED: This was added to make sure there is a module available before proceeding
if(module&amp;&amp;module.length&gt;0){
module.css(&amp;apos;background-color&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;#fffacd&amp;apos;);
setTimeout(function(){
module.css(&amp;apos;background&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;#fffff0&amp;apos;);
setTimeout(function(){
module.css(&amp;apos;background&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;transparent&amp;apos;);
},300);
},2500);
 
// scroll to new added module
varmoduleTop=(module.offset().top-50);
if(moduleTop&gt;0){
$(&amp;apos;body&amp;apos;).scrollTop(moduleTop);
}
 
// load status
dnn.controlBar.loadStatus();
if(dnn.controlBar.status){
if(dnn.controlBar.status.addNewModule){
setTimeout(function(){
$(&amp;apos;#controlBar_AddNewModule&amp;apos;).click();
},500);
}
else{
setTimeout(function(){
$(&amp;apos;#controlBar_AddExistingModule&amp;apos;).click();
},500);
}
}
}
}

DNN-26928,1.0,"Wrong handling of AllowNullBannerType in /Admin/Skins/Banner.ascx.cs I belive, there is an error in handling of AllowNullBannerType property in /Admin/Skins/Banner.ascx.cs.
In the original code, if AllowNullBannerType is set to true, then code uses provided BannerTypeID value. And if  AllowNullBannerType is set to false (this one is default), then code ignores provided BannerTypeID value and uses one from PortalSettings.
So, this code shows no banners at all:
&lt;dnn:BANNER id=""dnnBanner1"" runat=""server"" GroupName=""MyBanners"" BannerTypeId=""4"" BannerCount=""4"" Orientation=""H"" /&gt;
And this code shows banners of type 4:
&lt;dnn:BANNER id=""dnnBanner1"" runat=""server"" GroupName=""MyBanners"" BannerTypeId=""4"" BannerCount=""4"" Orientation=""H"" AllowNullBannerType=""true"" /&gt;
Solution is simple - we need to negate condition in this code, to restore sane behaviour, so if we don&amp;apos;t allow null banner type, then BannerTypeId must be specified. And if we allow null banner type, then BannerTypeId must be ignored and PortalSettings used instead.
int BannerType = 0;

Steps to recreate:
1. Create a blank portal with a 2-3 pages to test
2. Drop 2 HTML modules on the home page and add some dummy content. Edit the settings for one of the modules so it is set to ""Display On All Pages""
3. Navigate to Host&gt;Site Management and export the site, making sure ""Include Content"" is ticked.
4. Generate a child portal using the template
Expected Result: A portal with 2 HTML modules, one displaying on all pages.
Actual Result: A portal with 1 HTML module. The module set to display on all pages does not get created.
Opening up the .template file confirms that the module is getting exported, but something is preventing it from being created when generating a portal from the template.

I'd also be able to generate a patch that would make implementing these features a whole lot quicker for you


---

This will add Portal Level SMTP settings into the mix. I've added a radio button list to the SiteSettings control which will ask the user if they want the default host smtp, or the new portal based settings. The modifications next go into the Library\Entities\Host\Host.vb file, and check if the current portal has these settings specified, if they do it will return the portal settings and not the host settings. This should account for every custom module that uses SMTP without any breaking changes. No modifications were necessary in the Mail class. 

The only bugs I can think might show up, is if the current portal has portal smtp enabled and you go into host to check the host smtp it will probably return the portals settings, you'll need to goto the configured HostPortalId to view the host smtp settings in this case.

After an upgrade from 6.2.2, their rights no longer allow them to edit their banners or create new ones.  Even after they click on the 'Edit Page' (control page is turned on so they can use this function), the only thing that appears is the setting icon for the module and lists help. There is no pencil icon in the column to the left of the vendor name.

This must be completed by creating constant declarations for these in the FriendlyUrlSettings.cs file, as well as updating the references to the string constant in the FriendlyUrlSettings constructor.

2) Image attributes

* During installation, the system should allow (but not require) the JavaScript Library to be installed side-by-side with previous versions of the JavaScript Library.
* The JavaScript Library extension should support defining a debug script file.  When the system is set to debug mode in web.config, then the debug script if defined should be used.

DNN-3471,2.0,"BreadCrumb throwing an exception when using UserId as request parameter and type differs from int I recently encountered an issue with the breadcrumb control of DotNetNuke (to be found under /admin/skins). I am using the DPS payment on the site and when this redirects to the original site it uses a get-variable with the name ""userid"" this causes an issue with breadcrumb because of the property ""ProfileUserId"" which is also referring to the very same variable name. (The DPS-UserId is a string whereas the ProfileUserId is of type Int32 which results in a cast exception).

Here is how I fixed it:

        public int ProfileUserId
        {
            get
            {
                var userId = Null.NullInteger;
                if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.Params[""UserId""]))
                {
                    // Original below
                    //userId = Int32.Parse(Request.Params[""UserId""]);
                    // *** FIX START ***
                    // Fixed as the original could lead to an exception when the 
                    // request string is not a number (int32)
                    if (!Int32.TryParse(Request.Params[""UserId""], out userId))
                        userId = Null.NullInteger;
                    // *** FIX END ***
                    
                }
                return userId;
            }
        }

As the original line ("" userId = Int32.Parse(Request.Params[""UserId""]); "") could always result in an exception causing a page not to load, I would suggest to alter this to the provided code above.",,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DNN-3754,1.0,"SI: Redirect after registration not working Description - Customer has provided us with a bug that they found. Customers email following:

The logic in the if...else code block that checks if a Redirect_AfterRegistration page was set in Portal Settings, and sets the RedirectURL accordingly, is backwards. If a redirect page was set, the value of the

""Redirect_AfterRegistration"" portal setting returned is a positive integer value corresponding to the TabID of the page the new user should be redirected to after registration. If no page was set, or if the Administrator manually selects

""<none specified="""">"" for this setting, then the value returned is -1. Therefore, the logic in this code block (as currently shipped in version 7.1.1) is backwards and results in new users being redirected incorrectly after registering on

the site.

When the logic checks if the setting is &gt; 0, it should redirect to the URL of the TabID set for the after registration page. Otherwise, if a positive value was not returned (ie. no redirect after registration page was set), it should

then begin the code block to check for the returnurl parameter value (if sent in querystring), or remain on the same page if no returnurl parameter value was specified. The current code's logic blocks need flip flopped to work as

designed.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1. In Site Settings &gt; User Account Settings &gt; Registration Settings, set the User Registration type to ""Public"", Registration Form Type to ""Standard"", and set Redirect After Registration dropdown to any page (except the Home or Getting

Started pages) that is viewable by Registered Users. Be sure to Save settings.
2. If it is not already set, temporarily set View permissions on the Getting Started page to allow viewing by Registered Users.
3. Logout.
4. Navigate to registration page with a manually set ""returnurl"" parameter value in the querystring that would return you to the Getting Started page, as such: /?ctl=register&amp;returnurl;=%2fGettingStarted.aspx
5. Fill out the registration form as a new user and click ""Register"".
6. Note that instead of being redirected to the page you selected in the Redirect After Registration settings dropdown (which is where you should have been redirected to), you are redirected to the Getting Started page, which was passed

as the returnurl parameter value in querystring.

(NOTE: If you do not select a page for Redirect After Registration in the Site Settings, then you are always redirected to 404 or Home page (relative url path = ""/"") regardless of value for returnurl parameter. The reversed logic sees

that the value is not &gt; 0, so in the else, it tries to redirect you to page with ID of the returned setting value (which in the case where none was set, the returned value is -1). There is no page found with ID = -1 when NavigateURL

tries to resolve it.)

CURRENT CODE (BUG is found in Lines 138-166 of \DesktopModules\Admin\Security\Register.ascx.cs):


protected string RedirectURL
{
get
{
string _RedirectURL = """";

object setting = GetSetting(PortalId, ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"");

if (Convert.ToInt32(setting) &gt; 0)
{
if (Request.QueryString[""returnurl""] != null)
{
//return to the url passed to register
_RedirectURL = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString[""returnurl""]);
//redirect url should never contain a protocol ( if it does, it is likely a cross-site request forgery attempt )
if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""://""))
{
_RedirectURL = """";
}
if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""?returnurl""))
{
string baseURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(0, _RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal));
string returnURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(_RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal) + 11);

_RedirectURL = string.Concat(baseURL, ""?returnurl"", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(returnURL));
}
}
if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(_RedirectURL))
{
//redirect to current page
_RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL();
}
}
else //redirect to after registration page
{
_RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL(Convert.ToInt32(setting));
}
return _RedirectURL;
}
}

CODE FIX (Reversing the conditional logic Code Blocks resolves this bug and the New User is redirected correctly after registering.):


protected string RedirectURL
{
get
{
string _RedirectURL = """";

object setting = GetSetting(PortalId, ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"");

The problem occurs in the stored procedure GetPortalsByUser, which uses a view called vw_Portals. 
This contains the field LogoFile that is made out of the following query:CASE WHEN LEFT (LOWER(PL.LogoFile) , 7) = 'fileid=' THEN (SELECT Folder + FileName FROM dbo.fv_vw_Files WHERE fileid = CAST((RIGHT (LOWER(PL.LogoFile) , Len(PL.LogoFile) - 7)) AS int)) ELSE PL.LogoFile END
This is where the cast error comes from, because it is casting the last character of logo.png ('g') to an INT.

Solution: Add a new logo in sitesettings. It will change the default 'logo.png' to something like fileId=1.

Isn't that nice and pretty? After doing some soul searching, I was able to track down the cause of the problem, and come up with a solution. The problem comes from the fact that I previously used the Ifinity FriendlyUrl Provider for DNN. Even though I am no longer using it, the DLL for the provider still exists within my installation's BIN folder. Something in DNN 7.1.2 changed, and now there is a conflict with this DLL. You'll need to delete the iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider.dll from your website's BIN folder. You will also need to find any references to the DLL/NameSpaces in your web.config file.

Replace this (this first one probably isn't used in IIS 7+ websites, but if your web.config has it, change it)

<add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""iFinity.DNN.Modules.FriendlyUrl.UrlRewriteModule, iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider""></add>

with this

<add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""DotNetNuke.HttpModules.UrlRewriteModule, DotNetNuke.HttpModules""></add>

and replace this

<add name=""UrlRewrite"" precondition=""managedHandler"" type=""iFinity.DNN.Modules.FriendlyUrl.UrlRewriteModule, iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider""></add>

with this

<add name=""UrlRewrite"" precondition=""managedHandler"" type=""DotNetNuke.HttpModules.UrlRewriteModule, DotNetNuke.HttpModules""></add>

Then finally your friendlyUrl section of the web.config should most likely look like this

 
<friendlyurl defaultprovider=""DNNFriendlyUrl"">
<providers>
<clear></clear>
<add includepagename=""true"" name=""DNNFriendlyUrl"" regexmatch=""[^a-zA-Z0-9 _-]"" type=""DotNetNuke.Services.Url.FriendlyUrl.DNNFriendlyUrlProvider, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" urlformat=""Advanced""></add>

Warning Should say:
""This package is not verified to be compatible with Azure SQL Database""

Explanation Text should say:
This site uses Windows Azure SQL Database for database storage, and the package you are currently installing has not been verified by the owner to be compatible with Windows Azure SQL Database.   If a non-compatible extension is installed, it can stop successful backups and restores of the database, and can cause run-time errors once the extension is in use.   You may continue the installation process if you have verified the compatibility of the extension yourself, or click Cancel and contact the owner of the Extension to ask for an Azure SQL Database compatible version

Checkbox should say:
Install Extension without Windows Azure SQL Database verification anyway?

Test case 
1. Obtain access to site that uses SQL Azure as database (Azure QA cloud sites are avaialble)
2. Get any extension, inspect the manifest file for the <azurecompatible> tag.
3. If the tag is marked to 'true', start an installation process.  The 'Azure Compatible warning' should not show up.
4. If the tag is not in the file, start an installation process.  The 'Azure Compatible' warning should show up.
Note : to do 3 / 4 above, it is simple to open the install package, modify the manifest file, save and re-zip to create two different versions, one with, and one without the azure compatibility.
5. If the tag is missing, then ticking the 'install anyway' check box should continue the installation as normal.

For example, when adding a new or existing module, and then hovering over the 'crossed arrows' to select the panel for placing the module, the scroll bar is very thin.

It is able to be used with a mouse and pointer, but not with touch.

The scroll displays this way in several other locations withing DNN.  Each module uses this same interface on the page where is it installed.  If you want to move the module using the 'crossed arrows' interface, the scroll bar is the same, thin design. All should be modified to work with touch.

Although I (and probably most) developers use a standard PC with a keyboard to use this function, there are times when I am on the road and have to make a change with a touch device.

The fix in DNN-3373 was to add two properties to the {{DnnPageDropDownList}} control, to determine whether to include hidden pages and pages of ""all types"" (i.e. URL pages).  However, in addition to optionally allowing selection of those pages, even if those two new properties are {{false}}, the children of those pages still need to be available to be selected.

# Add a disabled page
# Add non-disabled children to the disabled page (via the Admin -&gt; Pages module, since that page won't be an option via the Add New Page command in the control panel)
# Add a page, setting the ""Link URL"" setting in the Advanced Settings -&gt; Other Settings section
# Add non-URL children to the URL page
# Select Add New Page from the control panel

DNN-3937,2.0,"Config component in manifest throws errors when XML Merge script is in separate file According to http://www.dnnsoftware.com/wiki/Page/Manifest-Component-Installers-The-Config-Component, the Config component within a manifest should support specifying the XML Merge transformations in a separate file, rather than embedding them directly into the manifest.  This would look something like this:
","<code>
<component filename=""Install.xml"" type=""Config"" uninstallfilename=""Uninstall.xml""></component>
<code>

However, there is a null reference exception that occurs when the {{ConfigInstaller}} tries to commit the change.  This is because the installer is trying to reference {{TargetFile.FullName}}, but {{TargetFile}} is only set when the {{fileName}} attribute _isn't_ set on the component.

The simple fix would be to check whether {{TargetFile}} is {{null}}.  But this overlooks the bigger issue, which is that when the XML Merge script is in a different file, the changes in it are applied directly to the target file (e.g. web.config).  This is in contrast to when the XML Merge script is included inline (and to components of other types) which apply changes to temporary files and then commit once the changes are verified as successful.

So, in this case where the installation fails because of the null reference exception, those XML Merge changes to the web.config are still applied to the site, and not rolled back, because they took place against the site's web.config already, before the Commit stage.</code></code>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Repro Steps
1. Install 7.2.0
2. Install a skin that uses the DNNMenuProvider (https://multifunction.codeplex.com/)
3. Apply the skin to a page in the website

Expected
1. No errors in JavaScript Console
2. Menu renders correctly and is usable

Actual
1. Error in JavaScript console (Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined in file dnn.controls.js)
2. Menu is rendered as a plain unstyled list

Root Cause
1. This bug was caused by a change to dnn.extensions.js which added a function ""dnn.extend()"".  This function name already exists in dnn.js and is used when rendering the menu.  As a result of the name collision, I would expect to see other odd behaviors as this method is used in 19 different JavaScript components used in the core.

        SET @bound  = @PageSize * @PageIndex + 1
    RETURN @bound

and

 FUNCTION PageUpperBound

post 12/23/2013 9:46 AM by Marco Kijlstra)

I ran into a high CPU problem on our production server last week. (DNN version 6.2.5). The problem did not manifest itself on our single core test-environment, nor in our development environments. There also seemed to be no relation between any particular request and the probability of the problem occurring.

I made dumps using DebugDiag and the (32 bit version of) taskmanager. Analyses of the dumps with WinDbg  showed all of the runaway threads busy with an Insert call on a generic dictionary in the UserController.GetCachedUser method.

This method indeed gets a dictionary from the cache and sets a value on it. The dictionary is a common generic dictionary, not thread-safe. However the object is shared among threads through the cache, and thus a thread-safe dictionary should be used.

I have fixed this by changing line 242 in method UserController.GetUserLookupDictionary so that the CBO.GetCachedObject overload with the saveInDictionary parameter is used, having set the saveInDictionary  parameter to true.

I have attached the fixed version of UserController.cs. See lines 242-251

This bug probably also affects all 7+ versions and earlier 6.. versions. because the offending methods have not been changed.

So far, the high CPU problem has not returned in the past 24 hours. Before the fix, the problem would manifest itself one or more times per hour.

DNN-4664,8.0,"Allow 404 Exception Bubbling from Modules This item relates to the ability for a third-party module to raise a 404 and have the standard DNN 404 handler catch and handle it.

The DNN 404 handler does the following things:
1) logs the 404 to a special 404 exception type
2) shows the portal-specific 404 page
3) sends back a 'true' 404 status code, instead of the asp.net standard of generating a 302 redirect to an error page.

When module developers wish to intentionally throw a 404 error in their code (such as when a wrong-for-the-module URL is requested, such as a non-existent blog post), they cannot currently get the DNN 404 handler to deal with this.  This is because the general-exception handling catches any raised 404 exception, and turns it over to the general exception handling behaviour, which is to show an error page.

The requirements for this change are to:
1) Allow a module developer to raise a 404 exception in their module code
2) Have an unhandled 404 exception bubble up until it is in the main DNN Exception handling code (for the page lifecycle)
3) Have 404 exceptions passed-through as a special case to the URL Rewriting 404 Handling code, so that it will return a 404 status code and show the portal-specific 404 page.

Test Case
-------------
For the test case, a module will have to be built which has a simple way of generating a 404.  This is suggested to be a simple module with a view control that returns a 404 if you reuqest a set URL (ie /status/404) for the page the module exists on.  This module should be built as part of making the change and provided to the QA team.   The module should also have a way of generating a 'generic' 500 exception, to show that the normal exception handling is not affected (ie /status/500)

Step 1 : Verify that 404 handling is working as expected (example.com/junkurl)
Step 2 : Install the exception-testing module
Step 3 : Request a 404 Exception

-Expected Result-
Shows the same 404 page as Step 1

Step 4: Request a 500 Exception
-Expected Result-
Shows the DNN error page, and not the 404 page.",,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

When I enable JS minification on the site, all form validation stops working. After looking at the combined and minified files, I can see the start and end line for the store.validation.js file but all the JavaScript for that file is missing.

There is a known (and fixed) issue in JSMin.c that causes it to not correctly parse regex strings like /[/']/ as the 2nd / is interpreted as the end of the regex.

Here is a link to the github diff that shows the fix. https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSMin/commit/55809e6d07be4a0d3029d48112d16ef833e55cf7

I propose two things:

First, we should update JSMin to a more up-to-date version.

Posts with EVERYONE permission should be searchable for registered non-community members

Steps:
1, As Host, create three users - user1, user2 and user3
2, Create a role - SG
3, Assign the three users to SG role
4, Create a page, put in page menu and delete HTML module
5, Add Social Group module, auto config, and create a public group
6, Grant View permission for the page to SG role and ensure that SG also has View permission for Social Group module
7, Copy permission to child pages
8, User1 and user2 join the group
9, As user1, post some contents with permission - EVERYONE to Journal module
10, Run Search Site Crawler
11, As user3, try to search the posts

Actual results:
User3 cannot find any post

Expected results
Although user3 is not member of the social group, because the permission for the post is EVERYONE, user3 should be able to search and read it

DNN-4848,2.0,"Possible Race Condition in UserInfo.Social When simultaneous calls are made to a user object during the Social building stage of that user, the calls appear to create a race condition when caching the Social object.

I noticed that the Social object is governed under a Dictionary object.  Dictionary objects are known to not be thread safe, and this could be what is potentially causing the issue.

Attached image of error message.

Troublesome code is as follows (UserInfo.cs):

[Browsable(false)]
        public UserSocial Social
        {
            get
            {

                }

                if (!_social.ContainsKey(PortalID))
                {
                    //_social[PortalID] = new UserSocial(this);
                    _social.Add(PortalID, new UserSocial(this));

                return _social[PortalID];
            }
        }

Possible resolution:

        private object _social_lock = new object();

        public UserSocial Social
        {
            get
            {
                lock(_social_lock) {          // *** Add a lock (more efficient solutions may also exist)
                if (_social == null)
                {
                    _social = new Dictionary<int, usersocial="""">();
                }

                if (!_social.ContainsKey(PortalID))
                {
                    //_social[PortalID] = new UserSocial(this);

                return _social[PortalID];

DNN-4853,2.0,".dnnUserFileUpload is undefined when using $.fn.dnnComposeMessage Active Forums (and probably other modules) use the javascript $.fn.dnnComposeMessage to send a private message to a user.

Since 7.2.0 the ComposeMessage.js adds a function at line 105 I guess to support uploading a file. It brakes the messaging in the case of Active Forums and maybe other modules.

Commenting the function resolves the issue, but probably breaks something else, so maybe someone with more knowledge of this newly added feature can come up with a better solution.

To reproduce:
- Install Dnn 7.2.1
- Install Active Forums 5.1.4
- Create two users
- In Active forums, select standard messaging in the module settings
- Create a post
- Login with another user and navigate to that post
- Click the envelope icon next to the avatar
- Notice the "".dnnUserFileUpload is undefined"" javascript error in the browser console
- Notice the message popUp does not show

After investigations with my associate Vincent, we have found  the cause :
As we are Mobile, It search an alias for Mobile (and don't find one)
See : Capture5.PNG

We can't create the same alias for Mobile Browser in DB as there is a Unique Index on the colum HttpAlias.
perhaps the index should be on the paired HttpAlias / browserType to allow to have a same on for both case when needed.

The proposed fix is to get  the foundalias without filter by browser type, It should still work when  BrowserType Mobile will be settable.( Not sure about the BrowserType objectives beside mobile redirection).

See : Capture6.PNG

Once fixed we get :
See : Capture7-withfix-en.PNG, Capture7-withfix-fr.PNG and Capture7-withfix-de.PNG

The bug is more visible if you play a little with alias by domain as here :
see : Capture8-realias.PNG

Without fix, you get a lot of 404...

With fix :

Since it is trivial to get an {{XPathNavigator}} from an {{XmlNode}} (but not vice versa), I believe that all of the methods which only accept {{XmlNode}} instances must have overloads added which also accept {{XPathNavigator}} instances.

The solution is to check that the redirect logic runs prior to returning a 404 status, to allow external components the ability to check for a redirect before returning a 404.

IMO no style sheets should be loaded by the Core after skin.css as an admin should be able to override all CSS in either Skin.css or Portal.css

When these style sheets get injected later, the css in them is very difficult to override. (this is not a theoretical issue)

solution:
Respect the default stylesheet order in DNN for all injected style sheets.
So after IMO they should be injected after default.css

In version 7.3.0 this method has been changed to now call SchedulingController.AddSchedule passing 13 properties with the latest property of the ScheduleItem being ""ScheduleStartDate""

 ""ScheduleStartDate"" property was added to the ScheduleItem class in 7.30 but is not there in version 7.20

DNN-5613,2.0,"SI: Problem with Module Controller and 17k value Customer has reported a bug that is present in the Core DNN API which affects the module settings table when a character of size 17k is added to the column SettingValue.

From Customer: 

Here is a screencast of the bug happening and being debugged in DNN's code:
http://screencast.com/t/PcaQrv6W
We've investigated this method (UpdateModuleSettingInternal) further and we have found what is the problem.
ModuleController.cs line 685
The method uses a datareader in order to determine if a setting already exists in the ModuleSettings table and add or update the setting as it is appropriate. This is a VERY bad idea, DataReaders keep their connection with the tables they use open while they themselves are not closed, at least partially. You can imagine that trying to update a table that is being kept open milliseconds before can eventually result in a deadlock. That is what is happening in this case.
When the datareader reads the 17Kb Lorem ipsum that was already uploaded to ModuleSettings, the table gets locked, so when the code gets to ""dataProvider.UpdateModuleSetting(moduleId, settingName, settingValue, UserController.Instance.GetCurrentUserInfo().UserID);"" and calls the SP that updates ModuleSettings, the SP hangs when trying to update the table.
Since the data we where modifying in the table was already there, we commented in UpdateModuleSettingInternal all that had to do with the datareader and AddModuleSetting. This made the code work flawlessly every time instead of hanging every time.
Possible solution for this: My approach would be something like removing the datareader, and instead checking for an existing row at stored procedure level. The ""If exists"" statement has a better performance and has the perk of not locking the table after it has run. Then, in case the row exists, insert or update as needed.
Of course, this is just a suggestion, but bear in mind that since the column SettingValue is nvarchar(max), large values are not beyond the scope of what could happen (and we have proved it happened in one of our clients).
We just wanted to let you know of the problem and a possible fix. Let me know if I can be of any futher help with this issue.


Please see attached ticket for more details on this issue.

When I copy paste the skins and containers folders from ""0-System""  to the ""0"" I can select the skin in admin&gt;Themes.

Is that complete analysis necessary that early?

One reason for the initial trigger is to filter out assemblies that won't load properly as can be read in the class. 
Attached is a modification where a list of such faulty assemblies is computed to a file to avoid that check on each startup, but the catalog is further parsed when parts are later composed in the code, so the performance gain is only from not throwing unnecessary exceptions, which is negligible.

When developing a simple MVC module (the one from: http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/155216/module-development-in-dnn-8-1-introduction-to-mvc-modules can be used to reproduce the problem), and trying to add it to a page more than once, nothing happens on sub subsequent module adds.

Steps to reproduce:
 1. Install the module
 2. Create a new page
 3. Click Modules -&gt; Add module
 4. Search for the module and drag &amp; drop it on the page
 5. Repeat steps 3. and 4. Instead of an additional module nothing happens
 6. Delete the module
 7. Repeat steps 3. and 4. Module is added.

No error appears from either the server (a 500 response in developer tools if monitoring the traffic), nor is there an entry in the error log.

If you now modify the database to ""undelete"" the deleted module in step 6, both modules will appear, but:
 1. the first module on the page will appear correctly,
 2. the second module on the page will show ""System.ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null.

If you now delete the first module, the second one will render correctly and if you now undelete the first one from the database (setting IsDeleted = 0), both Will now show correctly until you recycle DNN.

Plase note that we have identified that the problem with adding multiple modules exists in the out-of-the-box installation of DNN 8.0 CTP2 and normal modules, i.e. without installing any extensions you can *not* add multiple HTML Editor modules by drag &amp; drop. However, if you use the delete, add &amp; undelete procedure from above, all HTML modules are rendered correctly, not just the first one.

When the a user is forced to change their password, they are taken to a page where they confirm their username and new password. On a child site, the url for the users password reset page is missing the child portal portion. For example, the parent 'localhost' can be reset correctly, but the child 'localhost/test' does not because 'test' is missing from the url. If 'test is added to the url manually and the page is refreshed, a user can change the password.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a child site and a test user.
2. Force a password reset on the users next login.
3. Login with the user and attempt to change the password.

Expected behavior: The password is updated and the user can login with the new password.

If you create the scheduler using the host admin UI, the server name is pre- and postfixed with a comma and stored as "",ServerName1,"" in the database.

If you do not use the UI and the server name is stored without commas, you get strange behaviors: At some point the scheduler stops running. IMHO the problem is caused by the stored procedure ""GetSchedule"" that requires the commas. On the other side DotNetNuke.Services.Scheduling.SchedulingController.CanRunOnThisServer(..) does not require commas.

I believe that the {{EndDate}} property is being set as part of [setting up the {{ActiveTab}} property of {{PortalSettings}}|https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/blob/a27a2927aac16ca169258494005398ca4fb1c5fb/DNN%20Platform/Library/Entities/Portals/PortalSettingsController.cs#L94].  In addition to {{EndDate}}, other columns that are set include {{SkinSrc}}, {{ContainerSrc}}, {{IconFileLarge}}, and {{ContentItemID}} (not to mention the audit/version columns that always update).

I believe that the lack of an associated Content Item is probably what is triggering the saving of the {{TabInfo}} with bad data, but I haven't been able to track down exactly where that part is happening.

Please be noted, I once have customized login page and registration page assigned in ""Admin &gt; Site Settings"". 

Steps to reproduce:
1) add account login module on page
2) add account registration module on page

Expected Result: You should be able to use each module separately as needed.

Actual Result:  If you put both login and registration modules on the same page, registration works, but login does not. Login tries to validate the input fields of the registration module, when it should only validate username/password.
