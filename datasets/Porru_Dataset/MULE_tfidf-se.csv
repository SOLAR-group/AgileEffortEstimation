MULE-5382,0.0,"XSL Transformation fails with xsl:result-document on repeated transformations xsl:result-document outputs a file to the configured href.  

The first time the transformation of a particular file is carried out it succeeds, after that it fails with the following error.

""Cannot write more than one result document to the same URI, or write to a URI

In my particular set-up, Mule is listening on a particular directory. When a file is dropped in that directory the transformation is applied.  When I drop the same file a second (or third etc.) time I see this error.

It seems probably that the issue is because the transformer is not getting reset after each transformation.

After collecting statistics for each MBean, I reset the bean by invoking ""clearStatistics"" with no arguments, so that I can come back and collect fresh statistics later.

Howeven, when I do this while mule is under load, I see that the ComponentStatistics class starts to throw an exception on a divide-by-zero error. It tends to happen on multiple processor threads, and it seems to be a persistent issue - i.e. it throws the error every few seconds until I restart mule. I am uncertain if a message is trapped in limbo due to the repeated exception, but I think it may be as the message seems to repeat over and over again.

MULE-6759,5.0,"Http dispatcher thread leak There is a leak of HTTP message dispatcher threads.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Copy hello example app to <mule_home>apps folder
2) Start mule
3) Send a request: http://localhost:8888/?name=Ross
4) Remove the hello example app's anchor file and wait for the app to be undeployed
5) Obtain a thread dump of the mule process

Expected result:
No hello app related threads are in the list of live threads

Actual result:
There are two:
A) One named XXX.processing.time.monitor which is related to MULE-5276
B) One named http-request-dispatch-XXX (which is only created if previous point 3 is executed)

The number of B) threads is increased every time you repeat the deploy/exercise/undeploy steps

I debugged it and found the cause:

DefaultMessageCollection.setPayload() has been called by DefaultMessageCollection.transformMessage(MuleEvent, Transformer).

And DefaultMessageCollection.invalidatedPayload field value is true. 

The 2sec passing parameter of DefaultMessageCollection.transformMessage(MuleEvent, Transformer) method is a transformer which I do not custom, and it will transform message to a String result.

I cannot understand what does the code "" if (this.getPayload() == payload) "" of DefaultMessageCollection.setPayload() mean, this.getPayload() is a collection and payload is a string by previous transformMessage() method. I think it should call addMessage(MuleMessage message) to add all objects returned from components in the <all> router.

MULE-6889,2.0,"Concurrent Modification Exception when using the Async Message Proccessor inside a foreach It's getting more usual in iApps that we get a collection of elements, and we want to process each element asynchronously. 

For that reason, we are using the ""for-each"" message processor, and inside it, we throw an ""Async"" with a ""Flow-Ref"" to the flow that process each element.

The problem is that it's seems to be a bug that randomly (let's say 4 our of 10) throws a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException.

As you can see in the log output, this exception is thrown while the Async is copying the event to create a new one to fire a new thread.

The exact error is located at DefaultMuleEvent.java:938, where it says:

message.getInvocationPropertyNames(). 

So, what i guess it's happening here is that when creating a new event, the copy is saving some kind of reference to the same maps instead of creating a new ones.

Then, if some new flow var is created in the process item flow, while the async is still firing new thread (that means, copy new events), they are getting mixed up and crash.

MULE-6986,5.0,"http:static-resource-handler fails when request path is '/' Given a http:inbound-endpoint with no context path, and a http:static-resource-handler with a resourceBase set, expect that visiting http://server:port should redirect or service http://server:port/index.html.

Noted the following issues:

1) Server actually sends a 302 redirect to '//', which is not handled well by modern browsers (Chrome)
2) Visiting http://server:port// actually returns the contents of index.html
3) As a side-issue, visiting http://server:port/index.html if resourceBase does not have a trailing slash results in a file not found error (does not add the necessary slash)

Looking at the source here: https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/8de5e6b1de40e8d5f792e8e0f0b9d1de7506c2d8/transports/http/src/main/java/org/mule/transport/http/components/StaticResourceMessageProcessor.java

The issue is that the request path is stripped back from '/' to '' here:

","<code>
 String path = event.getMessage().getInboundProperty(HttpConnector.HTTP_REQUEST_PATH_PROPERTY);
 String contextPath = event.getMessage().getInboundProperty(HttpConnector.HTTP_CONTEXT_PATH_PROPERTY);

 // Remove the contextPath from the endpoint from the request as this isn't part of the path.
 path = path.substring(contextPath.length());
<code>

And so the following code fails to match on 'path.endsWith':

<code>
if (file.isDirectory() &amp;&amp; path.endsWith(""/""))
{
  file = new File(resourceBase + path +  defaultFile);
}
<code>

And the subsequent code block to redirect is used. The functional test cases don't catch this because the context path is not the same as the request path.</code></code></code></code>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

MULE-7090,5.0,"Make Mule rely on platform configured JCE provider instead of fixing on a predefined version TlsConfiguration gets defaults for several properties using an AutoDiscoverySecurityProviderFactory, which in turn provides defaults based on the JVM flavour in use.

In particular, it sets the default JCE Provider to use, the JCE Provider implementation class, the default Keystore type, and the default SSL protocol type being use.
This has several problems: 
* It doesn't allow to properly setup JCE providers as part of the platform configuration, something required to use a FIPS 140-2 compliant JCE provider
* It fixes on old versions of the providers and doesn't leverage improvements made in the platforms, like IBM's improved JCE driver (currently we use a JCE provider that is 6+ years old on IBM JVMs)
* It fixes the SSL/TLS versions supported, which causes SSL endpoints to support SSL3 (considered deprecated) but no TLS

The java platform provides sensible defaults for all these, which get updated as the security landscape evolves, and which can be defined as part of the JVM configuration. 
Remove the ""discovery"" of defaults, and use platform defaults for operations in and depending on TlsConfiguration.

Acceptance criteria:
It should be possible to use any JCE provider defined in the JVM environment in order to support FIPS compliant providers.
Endpoints should rely on the registered JCE provider for SSL and use the default ssl type instead of hardcoding one (As FIPS providers will disable several modes and only allow TLS 1.0+).

Therefore the QueueManager interface needs to add the following method:

void disposeQueue(Queue);

This method frees all resources currently held by the queue including the storage (meaning that queue.clear() will be invoked automatically)

However, in localhost:8081/test I'm trying to consume an operation which doesn't take any parameters. There's no way to make this work because:

1) WS consumer is expecting me to generate the soap envelope using datamapper, however, I don't have a payload to transform so I'm forced to create a dummy map
2) Because the operation is expecting no parameters, the XML that DataMapper generates looks like this: <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
3) The above results in WS consumer returning this error, basically because there's no envelope to consume:

org.mule.api.transport.DispatchException: COULD_NOT_READ_XML_STREAM. Failed to route event via endpoint: org.mule.module.cxf.CxfOutboundMessageProcessor. Message payload is of type: PostMethod

Error put aside, it doesn't make sense to me that:

* It seems like the only easy way to generate the SOAP envelopes is through DataMapper, which is not a CE feature like WS Consumer is
* How do I create a valid envelope when the operation takes no parameters?
* Because envelope generation depends on datamapper, I have to drop the WS Consumer box in the canvas before the DataMapper one. It's not natural for the developer to think the flow from right to left.
* Shouldn't WS consumer be capable of auto generating the envelope, at least when it requires no parameters?

h2. Explanation

The method *characters* of class *org.dom4j.io.SAXContentHandler* can generate multiple text nodes if *mergeAdjacentText* property is set to false.

An excellent explanation of the reasons of why this happen can be found [here|http://www.mail-archive.com/dom4j-user@lists.sourceforge.net/msg02690.html].

The effect of this problem is that certain xpath expression, most notably related to the use of the text() selector, can return an array of text nodes instead of a single text node. This can lead to incomplete text values or wrong comparisons.

This problem was discovered while dealing with a message properties transformer, where new message properties are added using xpath expressions to retrieve some values from an XML payload (this payload is converted to a DOM Document by means of the XmlToDomDocument transformer). 

This problem also affect the Expression Filter when using an xpath evaluator (uncomment the expression-filter element in the attached Mule configuration file to see it in action).

References to the Dom4j issue are reported in [Dom4j Case #117 - Problem with XPath and retrieving text |http://sourceforge.net/p/dom4j/bugs/117/?page=0]

Please find attached the Custom transformer that shows how to set the MergeAdjacentText property, the source code of xerces 2.9.1 and the xerces' binaries built with debugging information enabled (the binaries commonly distributed by Apache Xerces project have the debugging info stripped out).

For the CustomXmlToDomDocument transformer to work, uncomment the custom-transformer element in the attached Mule configuration file. Please take notice that the return class must be set to org.dom4j.Document.



h2. Workarounds

*1 - Use any of the following equivalent xpath expressions:*

<code>
#[xpath:/child::sswa2smtp/child::toAddress[text()]]
#[xpath:/sswa2smtp/toAddress[text()]]

The refactor made to improve the exception error (MULE-7521) modified the way of working with the OutputStreamWriter (look for ""out"" variable). After doing the #write(String) there is no flush(), hence the stream is not filled with the API response, and the response is always an error.

The code is:
","<code>
    //..
    try {
        out = new OutputStreamWriter(conn.getOutputStream());
        out.write(body);

MULE-7588,13.0,"LifeCycle is inconsistent across registries Because the LifeCycle manager handles individual objects instead of the mule context as a whole, there're differences in how the life cycle is applied to objects in the TransientRegistry in opposition to the ones in the SpringRegistry:

* Objects in the TransientRegistry have a correct life cycle
* Objects in the Spring registry that were registered by Mule's bootstrap, receive the Start and Stop phases correctly. They don't receive the dispose phase and the init one is invoked by Spring directly as an init-method, not through the life cycle execution.
* Because default Spring registry objects don't receive the init through standard life cycle phase, they cannot be started before the TransientRegistry
* Objects manually added to the spring registry by an app, don't receive the initialise nor dispose phases
* LifeCycle is applied on Spring registry objects once they're all available in the application context. However, objects in the TransientRegistry get their lifecycle as they're registered, making it impossible for component A to reference component B if A is not registered first.

mule-transports-http depends on tomcat 5.5.23 for cookie processing.
Upgraded to tomcat 6 version used by mule elsewhere using
${tomcatVersion}. Tomcat moved this into coyote. Verified working in
tomcat 6+. Defaulted httpOnly to false in this instance since it was
not part of tomcat 5 and not part of cookie from commons-httpclient and
thus was naturally already false. In tomcat 6, httpOnly is configurable
and default in tomcat 7+. This seemed most appropriate way to get onto
tomcat 6+ as tomcat 5 is end of life and solved use case we had running
mule within tomcat 7 &amp; 8.

That's because if you configure a threading pool of just one, the processing is not sequential just across the routers but across all executions of the flow. 

Another misbehaving use case is the one in which the routes are extremely fast, like just a couple of ms each. In that case, the overall response gain is lower than the time penalty of managing the threads.

To accommodate for these use cases we need to better support the sequential case of scatter gather, its threading profile type should change from asynchronousThreadingProfileType to threadingProfileType.

If the user does specify a return value, but no results were found then it returns NullPayload. If it came back with only one, then it returns that one element, even if you asked for an Array.

Although this is clearly a bug and a usability pain, fixing this could break some applications which are taking this bug as a feature. Thus, the result will be:

* By default, the xquery transformer will return a List
* That list will contain all the results, even if only one was found
* If no results found, then the list will be empty
* If the user did specified a return class, then we will fallback to the current behaviour (array, one element, or null).

MULE-8173,5.0,"Add protocol attribute to listener-config and request-config to improve usability Currently is difficult for an user to realice how to configure HTTPS for listening HTTP requests or sending HTTP requests. The way to do that currently is by defining a TLS Context element (which can be empty for sending request, in such case it will use jvm default certificatess) inside the listener-config or de request-config element. That it's not straightforward if the user is working with XML and for users that do not know that SSL / TLS is the protocol behing HTTPS isn't either despite they use Studio.

The idea is to add a protocol attribute (with default value HTTP) in the listener-config and the request-config.
- Listener config:
   - if user sets protocol=""http"" or provides no values then we validate that the user didn't put a TlsContext.
   - If user sets protocol=""https"" we validate that the user provided a TlsContext with at least a keystore configured on it. 
- Request config:
   - if user sets protocol=""http"" or provides no value then we validate that the user didn't put a TlsContext
   - if user sets protocol=""https"" and provides no TlsContext config then we create a TlsContext by default (implicitly) using the default jvm certificates
- if http is selected, port 80 is used by default
- if https is selected, port 443 is used by default

The usability improvements is:
 From Studio the user has a much more easy way to find where to define the use of HTTPS since it's going to be in the main configuration section of both listener-config and request-config
 From XML the user will see a hint from the XML content assistant to pick the protocol right in the listener-config element or request-config element.

With the new behaviour there's no reason to support an empty tls:context element in the config.
When we rebuild the current TCP transport ideally we can reuse the same mechanism as in HTTP (no idea what the ""protocol"" attribute would be called in that case) or add support for an empty tls:context again.

MULE-8210,8.0,"Support parameter grouping in Configurations and Operations There are cases in which a group of parameters are frequently used together, for which it makes sense to treat them as a group.

The extensions api already supports mapping pojos directly in the XML, but in same cases which group is preferred as parameters rather than a top level object.

To enable that, the @Parameters operation will be created

{code:java}

     @Extension
     public class MyExtension {

         @Parameters
         private Options options;
     }

     public class Options {
          @Parameter
          private String color;

          @Parameter
          @Optional
          private String mode;

          private String owner;
     }
 }
","<code>

The outcome of the code above is a configuration with two parameters called 'color' and 'mode', one required and the other optional.
The configuration has no attribute called options. If the Options class were to have another field also annotated with @Parameters, then such fields will be ignored.

In the same way, the annotation can be applied to a class holding operations:

{code:java}
     public class Operations {

         @Parameters
         private Options options;

         @Operation
         public void hello(String message) {
             ...
         }

         @Operation
         public void goodBye(String message) {

         }
  }
<code>

In this case, both operations will have three parameters: message, color and mode.

The last use case for this annotation is to have nested parameter classes:
{code:java}
     public class Options {

          @Parameter
          private String color;

          @Parameter
          @Optional
          private String mode;

          @Parameters
          private MoreOptions moreOptions;
     }
     }
<code>

In this last example, the configuration/operation that is augmented with this extra parameters will have the sum of Options and MoreOptions parameters. Those parameters will be flattened, meaning that the model will contain no reference to the fact that the MoreOptions parameters were nested inside Options.

For that purpose, two new annotations are created:

@Extensible: means that a given type is extensible by another extension. It doesn't mean type subclassing, but extension from a functionality point of view. This annotation has an optional String alias() attribute to allow a better experience when generating XSD

@ImplementationOf(type=XX.class): This annotation can be used on a class or method implementing operations. It means that the affected operations are to be part of a substitution group defined by an extensible type.

* read a message from an inbound endpoint (from a JMS queue or/and a database through JDBC).
* writing the message to an outbound endpoint (to a JMS queue or/and a database through JDBC).

{code:xml}

</multicasting-router>
</outbound>

","<code> 

What happens then if something goes wrong when writing the result to the outbound endpoint (eg. jdbc endpoint)? If you don't use XA Transaction on inbound and outbound endpoints, the message will not be rollbacked to the inbound endpoint in case of an Exception. So you will have to solve this issue by configuring <xa-transaction> on each endpoint with the appropriate transaction strategy.
 
{code:xml}
   <service name=""myBridgeService"">
<inbound>
<jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox"">
<xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_BEGIN""></xa-transaction>

<jdbc:outbound-endpoint querykey=""insertMessageStmt"">
<xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_JOIN""></xa-transaction>
</jdbc:outbound-endpoint>
</multicasting-router>
</outbound>
</service>
<code> 

But what happens now if you have a component between inbound and outbound enpoints ?

{code:xml}
  <service name=""myDaoService"">

<jms:inbound-endpoint queue=""/queue/inbox"">
<xa-transaction action=""ALWAYS_BEGIN""></xa-transaction>

</jdbc:outbound-endpoint>
</multicasting-router>

In most cases, the Spring object component (eg. messsageDao) will execute complicated business operations (from a currently existing business API) and also use a DataSource to execute several SQL select and update statements before returning a result to the outbound. These JDBC operations will be handled likely by Spring JdbcTemplate or even HibernateTemplate.

As far as I understand, Mule is fully responsible to handle enlistment/delistment and close of XA resources (see _org.mule.transaction.XaTransaction_). So by default, XA resources used by a Spring object component will not be handled by Mule and will not participate in the XA transaction started from Mule.

For completeness... I've also found a unit test for this usecase in Mule distribution under MULE_HOME/src/mule-3.1.2-src.zip/org/mule/test/integration/transaction/XATransactionsWithSpringDAO.java. When you execute this test, you will have a successful result but the XA resource used by the dao bean is not enlisted nor delisted in/from the transaction started from Mule. </code></code></xa-transaction></code>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

MULE-8786,8.0,"WSC with basic auth wraps ""error""s HTTP status code by throwing exceptions with timeouts When using WSC in conjunction with HTTP Basic Authentication (through HttpRequesterConfig) when bad credentials are used in the basic auth, the output I see is a timeout [1] rather than an exception caused by a 401 or 403 status code error.

To reproduce so, I'm attaching a small SOAP server (demo-soap-server.zip) and a mule app to try it out [2]. The endpoint I'm hitting is http://localhost:9000/acme-crm/orders?wsdl where the valid credentials are
user: admin
pass: admin.

In the mule app there are two flows to be executed 
* (a) http://localhost:8081/goodCredentials where once it's hit you will see something like the following in a browser
{code:xml}<ns2:createresponse><return>0</return></ns2:createresponse>","<code>
* and (b) http://localhost:8081/badCredentials where once it's hit you will wait for the default timeout of the WSC to be consumed, seeing at the end the stack trace in the mule app [1].

The issue here is that, despite the app will fail because of bad credentials, the developer should be warn that the error was an unauthorized rather than timed-outed.

I am using the salesforce connector v6.2.1 and this is how my authorize call looks like:

<sfdc:authorize accesstokenid=""#[flowVars['remoteUserId']]"" accesstokenurl=""#[flowVars['salesForceUrl'] + '/token']"" authorizationurl=""#[flowVars['salesForceUrl'] + '/authorize']"" config-ref=""sfdcConnectorConfig"" display=""#[flowVars['display']]"" state=""#[payload]""></sfdc:authorize>

The flowVar salesforceUrl can take 2 possible values, which are:
https://login.salesforce.com (Salesforce Production)
https://test.salesforce.com (Salesforce Sandbox)

When a user does the OAuth dance to login.salesforce.com at the same time another user does the OAuth dance to test.salesforce.com, one of the dances fail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe the problem can be found in the way the accessTokenUrl is retrieved and saved by these 2 processors (in mule-devkit-support):
- org.mule.security.oauth.processor.BaseOAuth2AuthorizeMessageProcessor<t>
- org.mule.security.oauth.processor.OAuth2FetchAccessTokenMessageProcessor

The BaseOAuth2AuthorizeMessageProcessor<t> (line 81) saves the accessTokenUrl value in the defaultUnauthorizedConnector object of the OAuth2Manager.
The OAuth2FetchAccessTokenMessageProcessor (line 57) obtains an OAuth2Adapter (used to fetch the access token) from the OAuth2Manager. The OAuth2Manager creates the adapter setting the accessTokenUrl (line 256 BaseOAuth2Manager<t>) with the value taken from the defaultUnauthorizedConnector object.

The problem is that because the generic is a wildcard, the ResolveableType  obtained by IntrospectionUtils.getFieldDataType() returns a null rawClass. As a result, the generated DataType points to a null class which in turn causes a NPE when an attempt is made to obtain a qualifier.

The SDK should:

* Ignore a type's generics one they contain at least one wildcard (consider cases like Map<string, ?="""">
* Log a warning when it founds a wildcard generic
* Also verify this behaviour for the case of operations in which the parameters are obtained from method arguments instead of fields
