Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open Titanium Studio.
2. Create a new project. Make sure the project supports Android.
3. Make one of the tokens in the Application ID an invalid java identifier (see below).

Expected Result:

An error message should appear and the project can't be created or an error message remains (if editing tiapp.xml).

Actual Result:

No error message appears. The project can be created. tiapp.xml shows no errors when viewed in the editor. The project can build to iOS, but the Android build fails with an error such as:

When you first launch Studio and then attempt to expand the disclosure triangle for the last project in project explorer, nothing happens. The triangle rotates, but no project content is displayed below the project name, and the scroll bar does not adjust for the new content. Since this is on Mac, it is possible to pull the project explorer window content up enough to see that there is indeed nothing there. Please see attached image with the window pulled up to show the lack of content.

This does not occur on 10.6.8.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Quit studio if it is open
2) Relaunch studio (be sure you have enough projects to fill your project explorer)
3) Open project explorer if it is not already
4) Scroll to the last project in the list
5) Click the disclosure triangle

Steps to Reproduce:

2. Open tiapp.xml in the TiApp Editor.
3. Change the runtime to Rhino (this creates an entry in the xml where there was none before: <property name=""ti.android.runtime"">rhino</property>).

Expected Result:
Rhino should be the default runtime.

TISTUD-1115,13.0,"Studio: Android SDK detection relies on script in latest Titanium SDK in mobilesdk folder, giving misleading info during failure Description:
To determine if the Android SDK is properly configured, Studio relies on a script (avd.py I believe) in the latest Titanium SDK in the Titanium SDK folder. This is problematic in some circumstances including when a developer installs a development Titanium SDK. Studio will automatically defer to this new version for verification of the correct configuration of the Android SDK. If there is an issue with the script or some other problem with the folder structure of the development Titanium SDK, it will disable the ability of Studio to use Android projects. Since it is not possible for QE to verify every development release has the correct structure and that the and.py script is present and functional, this is a potential risk area.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Configure studio to have 1.8.0.1 GA as the latest SDK
2) Install an SDK from master branch (1.9.0)
3) navigate to the folder for the 1.9.0 SDK and remove SDK FOLDER/android/avd.py
4) In studio, select the titanium preference pane or click ""configure..."" from the TIapp.xml overview

1. Check if a .project file exists in the specified directory;
2. Load project description from the .project file using IWorkspace.loadProjectDescription();
3. Check if the project description already contains the natures and builders that we need and only add the missing ones;
4. If the project description isn't modified because it already includes the natures and builders we need, there will not be a need to call IProject.setDescription(); otherwise, call the method to update the .project file.

This is relevant because projects imported into studio after being created by 'titanium.py create' do not initially contain tiapp.xml deployment target tags.
The tags are created on import based on the presence of a respective platform folder (i.e., NewProject/iphone).

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Generate a new iphone project using titanium.py create, such as:

While testing Xcode 4.3, I had an existing Studio install that could no longer detect the iOS SDK. The workaround for this was when I changed workspace to a new empty workspace. This fixed the problem. Please note, I did check the Xcode-select -print-path which showed the correct location. I tried it again anyhow. It was only when I quit Studio and relaunched, selecting a blank folder for my new workspace that the iOS SDK was recognized.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install Xcode 4.3 on a system with no Xcode install (delete 4.2 prior to 4.3 install) but with an existing Studio installation
2) Ensure that you have some projects that exist in the Studio workspace
3) Launch Studio and check the dashboard to ensure it reports your setup is incorrect (since Xcode 4.3 is not in the /Developer folder)
4) Use ""xcode-select -switch"" to set the location of your Xcode install to ""/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer"" this should fix your installation
5) Check that the Dashboard now reports iOS is configured correctly
6) Try to create a new project with iOS targets

Result:

3) Choose Project &gt; Clean and select only the project you created
4) Check the contents of the build folders

TISTUD-1380,8.0,"Studio: Tiapp.xml editor gets out of sync and warns of changes in filesystem. Description:
WHile testing, Natalie noticed that her changes to Tiapp (for the SDK version) were not being reflected, and subsequent builds were still using the previous SDK setting. We investigated, and noted that manipulating the pop-up for the SDK version would warn that the file had changed on the file system,and did she want to sync. With Shalom running us through some tests we determined a few things, most disconcerting is the fact that the Tiapp XML view had a different SDK listed than showed in the Overview. This explained the issue with building with the wrong SDK.

We still are investigating why the TiApp.xml is showing as out of sync from the file system perspective.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install and run Studio
2) Create a project and build for device
3) Open TiApp.xml editor and change SDK then save
4) Continue to change SDK and save until you get warned about file system sync

Result:
After a few moments you should see the sync warning. You may also notice if you examine the XML that the SDK setting is not matching.

Expected:
No sync warnings simply manipulating the tiapp. No SDK setting mismatch.",,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a lesser behavior of TISTUD-1268, which is fixed.

Summary of TISTUD-1268:

Content assist would intermittently stay open as a stand-alone window until studio was restarted.

The TISTUD-1268 fix:

If the content assist menu is up, and studio minimizes, the content assist menu will minimize as well.

Current Issue:

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open studio, create a new project, or open an existing javascript file.
2. Open content assist.
3. Click away from content assist.

Expected Result:

Content assist should close.

Actual Result:

Content assist intermittently stays open and will not close. This window is also persistent in the OS, though that related issue was fixed (TISTUD-913). When studio is minimized, content assist will minimize as well. When studio is maximized, the content assist menu is still there.

When attempting to get the PATH environment variable while executing a python compiler plugin, the PATH is incorrect. It does not include the user's current PATH, it only shows the following:

This makes it difficult for the compiler plugin to execute programs that are on the developer's PATH.

Loading in any 2.X build of Titanium Studio loads the correct dashboard.

This is a regression as this works in the 2.x builds.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install any Titanium Studio build in the 2.x range.
2. Upgrade from the nightly build to 3.3.0.201209032204.
3. Open Titanium Studio.

This information is not requested when running in emulator or on device. If the android builder.py is not passed a keystore it uses the default keystore shipped with the SDK.

The issue with this is that people who wish to use an app key, for say Google maps v2, are directed to use the default keystore to generate a debug key, and to generate their own keystore to create a production key.

This could eventually lead to situations where multiple keys are associated with the same keystore on the google side.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create an android project in studio
2) Attempt to package the project - note the dialog requesting Keystore info
3) Attempt to run on device

TISTUD-3981,8.0,"Alloy Debugger: wrong behavior setting breakpoints on functions under Android h5. Problem description
Debugger is not correctly handling a breakpoint set for a function in the controller .js file

h5. Steps to reproduce
Android OS tested: 2.3.6 Nexus One, Android emulator

See the sample attached.

h6. index.xml
","<code>
<alloy>
<window class=""container"">
<label id=""label"" onclick=""doClick"">Hello, World</label>
</window>
</alloy>
<code>

h6. index.js
<code>
function doClick(e) {  
	
    alert($.label.text);

}

$.index.open();
<code>

1. Set a BreakPpoint at line 3 for the'alert($.label.text);'
2. Debug the App on Android 

Result: App starts but the breakpoint is immediately triggered before displaying the Window (so just the splashscreen is displayed) and without having to click on the label.

From the Debug tab, it looks the behavior is wrong and that actually the wrong line is highlighted, focusing on the 'doClick() function' instead of the 'alert' function inside.

See the two screenshots, one for Android (wrong behavior), one for iOS (correct one, being triggered only when clicking on the sample 'label' for displaying the alert, not when starting the App).

3. Click to go past the breakpoint. Manually click on the app label to trigger the alert again.
Result: breakpoint is now ignored. Alert is being displayed.

","<code>

[INFO] :   Application has exited from iOS Simulator
[INFO] :   Project built successfully in 3s 58ms
<code>

This occurs with both the iPad and iPhone simulators. The order of the console output may vary slightly.

Also note that the behavior prevents the user from turning off LV and then launching on the first attempt. The first launch with LV off after encountering this error will fail with the same console output. The second launch with LV off seems to work fine. This may be a clue as to root cause.

h5. Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a default classic project in Studio
2) Enable Liveview and launch in the simulator
3) Make some edits if you wish
4) Relaunch the simulator - leaving liveview enabled

h5. Result:
Project fails to launch correctly in the simulator. Turning off LV and launching will also fail, but will work on the next and subsequent launches with LV off.

h5. Expected Result:
Project launches as expected and allows real-time editing

h5. Notes
I monitored the processes here, and it may be expected but subsequent launches of Liveview were killing the existing node PID and launching a new one.

TISTUD-5295,5.0,"Add diagnostic tests for troubleshooting npm configuration issues If any user has npm installation issues either with or without prefix configured, then it might not be very easy to judge the problem on the user's machine, especially with npm prefix configuration.

Instead of asking user each time to run a series of commands on their machine to figure out the underlying problem, we can add those commands in the diagnostic tests and that should let us give a fair idea on what is going on user's machine with just the diagnostic test logs.

When the NPM updates are invoked, either during startup or by the user -

1) It verifies whether the package is installed on the machine using 'npm -g ls <package>' command.
1.1) If the above command fails for any reason, then invokes 'npm -p ls -g'
2) If the package is available on the machine, it figures out the installed version and latest available version using 'npm view <package> version' command.

Also, since PREFIX is one of those dark areas, we need to add the prefix configuration to the diagnostic logs.

1) Environment variable : Get the system property for NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
2) Get the prefix key from the npm configuration : npm config get prefix
3) If only the environment variable is set, then the local prefix config value differs from the global one. That can lead to discrepancies in the installation of npm packages. So we should get the output for : 'sudo npm config get prefix'. However, since we don't hold user's password, this might not be a feasible value to store in the diagnostic tests.</package></package>",,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The basic gist of it is that we may want to copy and fork the p2.ui.sdk.scheduler plugin rather than just include it. That includes the standard automatic updates check and popup. We can then make our version do both checks and present our own UI.

Another alternative is to write p2 repository related code to allow loading the SDK metadata/artifacts and NPM package metadata/artifacts and converting them into the p2 model. That would make the same check for update job check all of them, but we'd still need our own custom UI override (though we may then be able to add metadata to the CLI package.json to do dependency checking against Studio?).",,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

TISTUD-6187,8.0,"Allow navigation between Alloy files under a hierarchical structure A suggestion from a user in TISTUD-3295:

I have one suggestion that can cover one use case that is being missed by this feature. In our app/controller folder, we have a hierarchical structure that organizes our controllers in a logical fashion. For instance, we have the following:

app/
app/assets/
app/controllers/
app/controllers/file1.js
app/controllers/file2.js
app/controllers/file3.js
app/controllers/file4.js
app/controllers/file5.js
app/controllers/templates/another_controller1.js
app/controllers/templates/another_controller2.js
app/controllers/templates/another_controller3.js
app/controllers/templates/another_controller4.js
lib/
lib/...
...

The same controller structure is mirrored for the styles and the views.

Now, when you open a controller, style or view that is not directly sitting in the folders app/controllers/, app/styles/ or app/views/, then you will not be able to use the new simplified navigation to open the other related files. The option will be greyed out.

It would be nice to have that use case supported.

When installing Appc Studio from the nightly stream on preview.appcelerator the install runs and shows no errors with the installation. However when attempting to open Studio and login the login fails.

After looking into this it appears that although the NPM package for appcelerator is installed into the Appcelerator Studio location, Appc CLI is not actually installed onto the machine. When checking the install folder inside the .appcelerator folder there are no installs.

I have installed the Appc CLI via command prompt and have managed to install it successfully, *please note* that to install via the CLI you will need to add an environment variable named APPC_ENV set to preproduction in order to get it to install properly, even with this it does not install fully from the Studio installer

When creating an Alloy project from Studio it makes two CLI calls, initially it makes an {{appc new}} call to create the project and then {{appc alloy new}} to generate an Alloy project. With the appc CLI it is unnecessary to make the second call and the it actually overwrites the ArrowDB related code injected to the app on project creation by the CLI.
